2025-06-08,why GOOGL (Alphabet) is a great buy right now,"With WWDC and the Robotaxi event next week, I'd like to discuss Google and its parent company Alphabet, they have been in trouble for a while now regarding some bullshit anti-trust cases, and I want to tell you why its pure FUD.

Bard was unimpressive, but that was only little over a year ago.  The speed at which they have been making new advancements is almost hard to track (even across other LLM's).

Have you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\*...\*

Regarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...

I dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.

# ----------- Fundamentals -----------

Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.

\-

**AI:**  

*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.

**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**

\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..

**Quantum Computing:**

\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.

**Smart Phones:**

\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time

**Streaming / Ads:**

\------*Youtube & Google Ads* \- Competing with Meta and Netflix

**Smart Home / Wearables:**

\------*Nest, Fitbit,* & ***XR Glasses*** \- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.

**Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**

\------***Waymo, Wing*** \- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*

**AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**

\------*Verily, & Calico* \- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.

\-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.

\-

When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...

[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)

\-

Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.

https://preview.redd.it/a61jyxhzwl5f1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b85188b91cd7b2b6b95516e18513586d86d630b

\-

# -------- Technical Analysis --------

so now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...

I like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.

I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.

\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.

\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.

\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.

\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&S on the daily chart to the top right.

https://preview.redd.it/d2fprue33m5f1.jpg?width=3676&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77f0a1e390e7b81ec6f893f6f38220ffc3fde21f

Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.

But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.

From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.

While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

\--------------

# TLDR:

**Alphabet is a great Bet !**

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.

**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth & value stock.

*Price Target short term - 180*

*Price Target long term - 200+*

Gonna try to keep this short.  I am writing this as a Tesla owner (love that car) and former Tesla bull.  I actually bought Tesla shares the day after the election, but then sold them at $385 for the initial $14,659.15 gain.  

When the Doge problems started being apparent, I started buying puts, hit the downslope decently from above $300 to the $240s.  Got out pre earnings to avoid IV crush and because for some reason TSLA always moons on earnings no matter how bad they are.  +\~$32K  
  
Last week, I started to get that itch again thinking, man TSLA is gonna go down again...didn't have any position...was thinking about it.  Then, as soon as Elon walked into the Oval Office with that black eye, I was literally tripping all over myself on both the phone and CPU to buy puts.  I think I got in at about 360 - 355 for the 7/11 dated puts, but TSLA was dropping fast as I was buying those.    
  
Then there was today, which was just amazing.  The stuff that dreams are made of.  Chef's kiss.  
  
Degenernates, it is my hypothesis that this is not over.  Tesla can go much, much, much lower.  Setting aside the ridiculous valuation, declining sales, and toxic brand.  The biggest asset that Tesla had, it's closeness to the Whitehouse, is now its biggest liability.  The US government can hurt TSLA in so many ways:  

* TSLA is operating under numerous Federal and State level permits that can come under scrutiny 
* Just yesterday, I watched a video of an FSD Tesla tragically unalive a pedestrian, might the company face criminal liability? (BTW they should call it F\*\*king Scary Driving, I've tried it out, no way am I getting in a Robotaxi) 
* Elon Musk has regularly done things (tweeting, self-dealing) that could warrant SEC investigations 
* Elon Musk could easily be picked up on drug charges

Anyway, I wanted to get this out in case anyone is still holding: **Sell. Right now.** After-hours, pre-market, doesn’t matter — just sell.  Some bigger fool will still give you 280, but only today.  There is no reason for a bounce. The meme lords will not ride in to save you. Don’t let sunk cost fallacy wipe you out.  There is no floor here. This stock is facing a fiscal and regulatory apocalypse with no edge and no center.

Alright regards, here's why there's still plenty of juice left in this TSLA correction.

1) Robotaxi release is gonna be a total bust/sell-the-news. Nobody trusts FSD, nobody would hop in a Tesla when they could easily get a Waymo that has been tested for multiple years. Press is going to be watching like a hawk for any mishaps/bugs, which there will be. This is definitely not going to be what investors were hoping for.  
  
2) Robotaxi release is high-risk, expect to see investors close positions leading up to the event. Cue in any number of videos showing FSD mowing down pedestrians or showing how bad a camera-only system is. I wouldn't want to risk a large position going into this. This whole robotaxi venture was dead the moment Enron refused to put LiDAR on the cars.  
  
3) There was hype surrounding Enron's departure from the administration. Would've taken a goddamn miracle but honestly if he left the administration quietly, making sure not to burn any bridges, maybe he could save the brand a bit while still getting the benefits of being close to the admin. Except now he's getting in brawls with the administration and trashing their bill. He's burning all the bridges.

4) Declining sales and other stuff that doesn't actually affect the stock price at all.

5) CPI next week, likely to actually start showing the effects of tariffs.

2025-06-04,1.3m $RDDT Bet - Too Many Ways to Win,"[YOLO my retirement](https://preview.redd.it/b79sltwwbx4f1.png?width=2762&format=png&auto=webp&s=2da693c6e85ac91a950290dc6ef77677fb3fb36b)

**TL;DR:** Reddit is massively under monetized compared to peers (ARPU of $3.63 vs Meta's $12+), but sitting on the internet's highest quality dataset for AI training. They're already making $100M+ annually from OpenAI/Google at 90%+ margins, with new revenue streams emerging (hedge fund data via ICE, premium subreddits targeting the creator economy). Management has proven they can monetize without killing the community. Multiple ways to win (ARPU growth, data licensing expansion, creator monetization).

Thesis: Reddit is the last major platform with truly authentic, human driven conten and every dollar they make from data, ads, or subscriptions flows almost entirely to the bottom line. That combination (community moat + 90% margins + under monetized user base) means there are tons of ways for shareholders to win.

**Moat/Why Reddit Matters**

Reddit’s value is in its data. Unlike algorithmic feeds that amplify engagement optimized content, Reddit's community moderated format naturally filters for substantive discussion through upvoting and downvoting mechanisms. This creates a self curating dataset where quality content rises organically. Reddit's niche communities offer domain expertise at scale. Subreddits such as r/AskHistorians or r/PersonalFinance provide high quality, contextual knowledge that is hard to find elsewhere. While other platforms deal with increasing bot activity and AI generated content pollution, Reddit's community moderation creates natural quality controls. Compare this to Meta or Twitter, where content moderation costs eat into margins. Reddit's community does the curation work for free, then Reddit monetizes that curation.

 

That makes Reddit a data goldmine for LLMs.

This creates a flywheel of engagement that’s not only sticky for users but incredibly valuable to AI and advertisers.

* Reddit is already pulling in \~$100M/year from data licensing deals with OpenAI and Google.
* That revenue flows almost entirely to the bottom line, pushing gross margins >90%.
* Unlike ad reliant platforms, this is pure margin, recurring revenue.
* Reddit has content tagged by subreddit leading to specific and niche domain knowledge which is super valuable for AI training. 

**The CEO and Why Management Can Execute** 

Steve Huffman cofounded Reddit in 2005 but left in 2009 to pursue his own startup journey. At Hipmunk, he gained hands on experience with the monetization challenges Reddit would eventually face: negotiating ad partnerships, building affiliate revenue streams, and learning how to balance aggressive growth targets with maintaining user trust skills that weren't part of his original toolkit as a pure product founder.

When Huffman returned as CEO in 2015, Reddit was stagnant, 

traffic growth had slowed, leadership was paralyzed by fear of change, and basic revenue infrastructure was missing. But he now brought a different perspective, having personally wrestled with the complexities of turning user engagement into sustainable revenue.

His turnaround demonstrates he can execute on complex monetization without destroying community value. He overhauled the interface, built mobile functionality, and completely revamped Reddit's ad offerings. More importantly, he implemented content policies and moderator tools that preserved Reddit's authentic culture while making it advertiser friendly.

This experience matters for the opportunities ahead premium subreddits, expanded data licensing, international ARPU growth because they all require the same delicate balance Huffman learned through his entrepreneurial journey: extracting maximum revenue from unique community assets without killing what makes them valuable.

**Growth Catalysts**

**ARPU Tailwinds vs. Facebook/Google/Meta**

Reddit’s ARPU is currently well below its peers and management is actively working on closing the gap.

Current ARPU Gap:

* US ARPU: $6.21 (+31% YoY)
* Intl ARPU: $1.34 (\~5× lower than US)
* Global ARPU: $3.63 (+23% YoY)
* Google Benchmark: Google Services generated $77.3 b in Q1 2025 (including $50.7 b search), with €6.35 p/m in Europe (\~$76 per year).
* Meta Benchmark: Meta’s ARPP was $10.42 per user in Q1 2025 (\~$12.36 TTM).

If Reddit can even approach half of Meta’s or Google’s yield in key markets, ARPU can more than double from here. When Reddit doubles ARPU from $3.63 to \~$7, you're looking at revenue growth with 90%+ gross margins. Even with zero DAU growth, that's \~$3B in annual revenue. Add conservative 20% DAU growth to 130M users, and you're approaching $3.6B in revenue. Right now Reddit’s market cap is 20B with the potential to generate $500M+ in quarterly free cash flow at those levels. And here is how they are going to do it. 

To increase ARPU Reddit is rolling out:

1. New ad formats (video, search, shopping) & better targeting & analytics for advertisers
2. AI powered content recommendations (already +30% in “Good Visits”)
3. Global machine translation (30+ countries)

I’m unsure if Reddit Answers will move the needle but it shows that the team is shipping fast and not afraid to experiment. 

**Emerging Data Monetization Beyond AI Training**

Reddit is now piloting financial data products through ICE, selling real time sentiment analysis and trend identification to hedge funds. This presents another new potential revenue stream. While still early stage, the addressable market for financial sentiment data is enormous. If Reddit can demonstrate alpha generation from their community discussions, institutional demand could create substantial revenue. Reddit's threaded discussions and voting mechanisms create cleaner sentiment signals than traditional social media noise. If Reddit can prove their data moves markets, they're looking at potentially hundreds of millions in annual recurring revenue from the finance vertical alone.

The speculative angle is whether other industries (healthcare sentiment, brand monitoring, political analysis) follow suit once Reddit demonstrates the model works with financial services.

**The Trump Call**

Anger is the most contagious emotion, and Trump makes people furious, which translates directly to engagement and revenue. During Trump's 2017-2021 term, NYT stock tripled (+227%) on the back of outrage fueled subscription growth, proving that political chaos drives monetizable engagement. Reddit thrives in this environment even more than traditional media. The platform's political subreddits already drive massive traffic during controversies r/politics regularly dominates the front page during major news cycles, and angry users spend significantly more time on platform, driving ad revenue and engagement metrics. As Trump continues generating daily headlines and controversies, Reddit becomes the primary destination for realtime discussion and debate. Unlike passive news consumption, Reddit's format encourages users to engage, argue, and scroll for hours through comment threads. This sustained engagement during Trump's presidency should provide a meaningful tailwind for both user growth and time spent on the platform, directly benefiting Reddit's advertising revenue and data value.

**Premium Subreddits**

Right now, NSFW content creators are farming engagement on Reddit for free, then redirecting traffic off platform to make money elsewhere. Reddit sees none of that profit. Reddit has explicitly discussed that they are working on premium subreddits. This keeps users on platform, and skims off that monetization by allowing creators to monetize directly on platform, with Reddit taking a platform fee.

Think OnlyFans creators paying Reddit a cut instead of just leeching traffic. This represents 100% incremental revenue with virtually zero marginal cost to Reddit as they're already hosting the content and communities.

OnlyFans generated $6.6 billion in gross payments volume in 2023, translating to $1.3 billion in revenue at a 20% take rate and $657 million in pretax profit. If Reddit's premium subreddit model can capture even a small fraction of this creator economy by leveraging their existing massive NSFW user base and superior community features it could substantially add to their revenue mix.

**Near Term Catalysts**

Reddit faces several key institutional milestones that could drive significant passive capital inflows. Russell 1000/3000 inclusion is scheduled for June 27, 2025, after market close, which should trigger automatic buying from index tracking funds starting that Friday. More significantly, if Reddit maintains its current profitability trajectory and scale, S&P 500 eligibility could arrive by mid 2026. The company's Annual Investor Day on June 9, 2025. I’m unsure if anything will serve as a catalyst for anything I’ve mentioned here but I’m excited to hear what their team is working on. 

**The Google Risk and Why It Doesn’t Matter**

Reddit’s top line still depends heavily on Google’s search algorithm, so whenever Google tweaks its ranking, Reddit’s traffic and revenue can swing. After Reddit reported Q4 2024 results in late February, the stock sold off sharply when search rankings dipped. The same thing happened in May, despite a strong Q1 2025 beat (year over year revenue up 47%). On the Q1 call, Steve Huffman cautioned that “growth will be bumpy,” noting that April daily active user growth slowed to 17%. Then the stock gave up its gains.

In reality, those monthly fluctuations don’t change the bigger picture: Reddit is still adding users and monetizing them at a fast clip. Short term search volatility simply means revenue and growth will be bumpy, but the overall trend remains squarely upward. The market is overplaying Reddit’s “Google dependency”. Even with occasional dips, Reddit’s growth trajectory is intact. Ignore the volatility and focus on the overall trajectory. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1l37l3m/13m_rddt_bet_too_many_ways_to_win/,wallstreetbets,"1.3m $RDDT Bet - Too Many Ways to Win.

2025-06-04,$APLD: This ain’t a stock. It’s a launchpad. Public Pureplay on the AI Bottleneck.,"I’m long APLD.

Applied Digital is a developer of next-generation infrastructure for AI. They have two segments: (i) custom-built, high-performance data centers; and (ii) GPUs as a service. Applied is currently focused on a large 400MW data center project in Ellendale, ND, and is marketing a 1.4GW pipeline of additional capacity. Please see the company’s latest investor presentation on their website for more details. 

There is a frenzy for compute power by both hyperscalers and Fortune 500 companies, covered extensively everywhere you look. Power and datacenter capacity is the new bottleneck. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen, has and continues to discuss the need to modernize a trillion dollars worth of data centers to tap into AI’s potential. APLD is a first mover aiming to capture this opportunity.

APLD’s history in developing power hungry crypto hosting sites in low-cost power locations was the perfect preparation for today’s AI opportunity. APLD’s foray into North Dakota for cheap electricity to fund crypto mining left the company with relationships and access to massive low cost power, low cost land with space for expansion, room for additional wind/solar farms to be integrated, state tax incentives, and cooler temperatures which are beneficial for the TCO of high density AI data centers. A healthy dose of luck contributed to locking up this opportunity, industry participants have told me you cannot underscore just how valuable this power and first mover advantage is for prospective customers. If GPUs are the pickaxes behind the AI revolution, power guys are swinging the axes.

**Unit Economics and Valuation**

**HPC Data Centers**
The rule of thumb for data centers is it costs $8-12 million per MW to build and each MW can generate ~$1mm of NOI. Applied Digital’s Ellendale campus has signed 250 MW of 15-year leases with CoreWeave, expected to generate $7 billion of total revenue over those 15 years (≈$466.7 million per year). That works out to ≈$1.867 million of revenue per MW per year. Assuming a typical HPC/data center EBITDA margin of 50–60 %, each MW will likely produce $0.9–$1.2 million of NOI per year. Therefore, the 250 MW currently under contract should yield $233–$280 million of NOI annually. At a 5–6 % cap rate, that implies an enterprise value (TEV) in the $3.9–$5.6 billion range for the signed 250 MW. If the full 400 MW build is leased at similar economics, total NOI would be $360–$480 million per year, implying TEV of $6–$9.6 billion. The remaining 150 MW of backlog could contribute up to $150 million of additional annual NOI—i.e., another $2.5–$3 billion of TEV—if signed at comparable rates. 

Locking in the 250 MW CoreWeave lease translates into roughly $3.3–$5.17b of equity, or about $15–$23 per share. Each additional 100 MW of backlog, using $0.9–$1.2 m of NOI per MW and a 5–6 % cap rate, would be worth approximately $5/share using the same math. If Applied is able to lock in 1.4GW of projects, that’s an additional $70/share of value that could be created. Haircut all of this however you prefer. The numbers can get wild.

**Applied Digital Cloud**
This segment has not been a focus for the company or the investment community recently, but is an underappreciated lotto ticket. Think of it as an early-stage CoreWeave. The business model is simple: they purchase GPUs from NVDA, install them in data centers, and lease them to customers for a fixed contract term that is typically 2-3 years. The GPUs typically pay for themselves during the initial lease term, leaving Applied Digital Cloud owning them free and clear at the end of the lease term for several more years of use. Applied takes very little risk here because at the time they purchase the GPUs there is already a contract in place for a full pay back of the equipment.

The NVDA investment is especially important for this segment because this is where NVDA can drive Applied’s future success. The hyperscalers are working on their own chips and are frienemies, so it is in NVDA’s long-term interest to ensure that there is a healthy ecosystem to support the consumption of their GPUs. They want companies like Applied and CoreWeave to prosper. NVDA can assure Applied’s success in a variety of ways by providing: (i) early allocations of the latest products; (ii) the best customer prospects who want to consume NVDA’s products as a service; and (iii) capital.

Consider what NVDA’s support did for CoreWeave. NVDA invested $100MM in CoreWeave in 2023 at a $2BN valuation. As of September 2024 CoreWeave was raising money at a $23BN valuation…. And look at where they are now. 

Valuing this segment is tricky because it is just getting started. If we assume it’s worth just 10% of CoreWeave, that’s $7BN. And it goes up from there. In the fullness of time, if Applied Digital Cloud prospers, then the company will spin this out as a separate company.   

**The High Level Setup**
Based on the recently announced data center lease with CoreWeave, it is clear that APLD is the real deal and has a chance to be a leader in the next gen data center buildout. BUT despite the recent surge in stock price, it has yet to go from zero to hero with the stock price still being vastly under valued.
 
Applied Digital will be the only pure play next-gen data center player in the public markets. There is no short thesis when NVDA and Related are anchor investors and a hyperscaler is a long-term partner and customer. APLD will fundamentally be worth a lot more than current prices, the stock should disconnect from any fundamental grounding as a result of being a public pureplay on the next AI bottleneck. The right tail asymmetry of this investment is under appreciated.  

**TLDR:** Company that used to mine magic internet money accidentally built a gold mine for AI. Now NVDA’s homies are renting it out, and the GPU gods might bless them with infinite tendies. Bags secured, brain not required

2025-06-02,BYD - the next Evergrande?,"For those that are unfamiliar with the story - Evergrande, once touted as too big to fail, [was the most valuable publically traded real estate developer in the world just 7 years ago](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-09/05/c_137446988.htm) with a market cap over 45 billion USD. Today, it is bankrupt.

While financial media will place the blame for Evergrande's fall on overleveraged lending, defualting mortgages, and collapsing housing prices; [Evergrande also frequently cut corners and ignored safety standards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKbLB_T-IjY&ab_channel=ADVChina) by using low-quality, or sub-standard building materials. [These are referred to in China as ""tofu dregs"" or ""tofu buildings.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu-dreg_project#:~:text=%22Tofu%2Ddreg%20project%22%20)

And today BYD is mired in a similar controversy surrounding it's EV sales practices in China - a story which could mimic the fall of Evergrande.

Although lany on WSB and in mainstream financial media like to proclaim BYD's dominance, often citing EV sales surpassing Tesla's - few are aware BYD's dirty secret.

BYD's vehicle sales have grown extraordinarily over the last decade from [430,000 in 2014](https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/byd-china-sales-figures/) to [4.3 million in 2024](https://tridenstechnology.com/byd-sales-statistics/). This has positioned [BYD as the #3 largest global automotive](https://roadgenius.com/cars/statistics/sales-by-manufacturer/) brand behind Toyota and VW in 2024, setting the stage for them to become #2 in 2025.

But recent criticism about BYD's sales practices from competitors brings into question the legitimacy of BYD's phenomenal growth.

Wei Jianjun, Chariman of China's Great Wall Motor, and other industry leaders are speaking out against a sales tactic employed by BYD referred to as [“zero-kilometre used cars.”](https://carnewschina.com/2025/06/01/exposing-chinas-zero-kilometre-used-cars-registered-but-never-driven/)

That strategy is simple but takes on a different name in the West where it is generally referred to as [""channel stuffing.""](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/channelstuffing.asp)

In practice, BYD and other EV manufacturers in China have been building an oversupply of vehicles and selling them to dealerships. This allows manufacturers to claim government subsidies for manufacturing EVs and meet short term sales targets.

Then the dealers offload the inventory on the market as a used vehicle (with 0 miles driven), at significantly reduced prices.

But this practice creates problems for the consumer. In China the warranty process typically begins at the vehicle registration date which starts when the car is sold to the dealership.

[And these vehicles will often sit on dealer lots or ""EV graveyards"" for months before they're sold,](https://mobilityportal.eu/ev-graveyards-europe-is-implementing-solutions/) leaving customer with reduced warranty coverage or worse.

In some cases, manufacturers have been taking advantage by cost cutting in important areas like paint and safety.The result is low quality cars are being deceptively sold ""as new."" 

This has lead to numerous issues with corrosion in BYD vehicles. [One social media user posted the undercarriage of his four year old BYD completely destroyed by rust](https://x.com/CharlesWBoy/status/1923343976980971751), swearing he will never buy another BYD again. 

[Similar stories surrounding a popular export model in Australia have been popping up.](https://autoexpert.com.au/posts/the-truth-about-the-byd-atto-3-ev-rust-problem) The main culprit appears to be a lack of adequate galvanization and/or dissimilar metal corrosion between some bolts and the subframe.

Some consumers are feeling scammed. BYD's warranty states ""Do not park the vehicle in dark and humid environment for long time; otherwise, **partial rusting and corrosion** of the chassis may occur."" And many of these cars are doing just that, as mentioned above, sitting in[ EV graveyards](https://mobilityportal.eu/ev-graveyards-europe-is-implementing-solutions/) before they're offloaded to the secondary market or exported.

In China, consumer protection laws are even worse and there is almost no legal recourse for such issues like the lemon laws consumers enjoy in the US. In China[, it's not uncommon for companies to sue consumers for defamation for speaking out against such practices.](https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2024/05/06/faults-in-chinese-french-cars-show-urgent-need-for-lemon-laws)

[And BYD has done exactly that, suing a car blogger for $700,000 who posted videos criticizing BYD's car failures and fires.](https://cnevpost.com/2023/07/24/byd-sues-car-blogger-over-defamation/)

On May 27, 2025, everything came to a head. [China’s commerce ministry convened a meeting ](https://cnevpost.com/2025/05/27/chinese-regulator-gathers-automakers-zero-mileage-used-car-sales/)with major players, including BYD, Dongfeng Motor, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), and the China Automobile Dealers Association (CADA). The subject was to discuss used car sales and the ""zero kilometer used car"" sale practice.

The China commerce ministry's intervention heralds stricter oversight and tighter regulations to come, which could prove problematic for major players like BYD.

But BYD may have other problems.

[EV makers in China are taking longer to settle payments with suppliers due to slowing sales and price wars, potentially signaling liquidity issues.](https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3263341/chinese-ev-makers-delay-payments-vendors-they-feel-heat-slowing-sales-price-cuts)

BYD took 275 days to pay supply-chain vendors in 2023, compared with 219 days in 2022, and 198 days in 2021, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.

NIO, a rival EV manufacturer, needed 295 days to pay suppliers, increasing from 247 days in 2022, and 197 days in 2021.

[Nigel Stevenson, an analayst at GMT Research (basically a Hong-Kong based Hindenburg Research), claims that BYD's net debt has surpassed 200% of its equity.](https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/here-s-why-china-s-ev-makers-have-a-good-reason-to-delay-paying-bills-125012200325_1.html) That number is dramatically different than what is reported on BYD's financial statements which indicate it holds more cash on it's balance sheet than debt.

This could explain why BYD's supplier payment period has been increasing for years. This effectively results in BYD receiving cash for a finished car before paying for the materials to build the same car - amounting to an interest-free loan from suppliers.

And this has been squeezing some suppliers out of business. In a social media post on Weibo, one journalist reported the story of a supplier who was forced to take out high-interest loans to cover debts because BYD had delayed paying them beyond 275 days. [According to national industry and commerce data, BYD is reportedly behind on 237.5 billion yuan in payments to suppliers—delays that have pushed 73 small and medium-sized suppliers into bankruptcy.](https://x.com/ray4tesla/status/1910581529123971408)

[By comparison, Tesla has recently shortened their supplier payment period from 100 days to 90 days in Shanghai](https://cnevpost.com/2024/11/28/tesla-china-payment-cycle-to-suppliers-90-days/). This has positioned Tesla as one of the friendliest automakers in China for suppliers to work with.

To add insult to injury, at the start of the year BYD asked suppliers to further cut prices by 10% in 2025 leading to backlash on social media and dissent from suppliers. [BYD's suppliers have put out statements condemning BYD's actions for violating business ethics](https://technode.com/2024/11/29/byd-suppliers-reportedly-dissent-over-latest-price-cut-request/) as well as endangering consumers because the only way to meet their demands is to reduce the quality of their products or using other ""unconventional measures"".

[Elsewhere in the world BYD has recently been scrutinized for its relationship to Jinjiang Group.](https://globalvoices.org/2025/03/10/after-complaints-of-mistreatment-of-chinese-workers-in-brazil-byd-watched-employees-closer/) Jinjiang Group is one of three companies BYD partnered with to outsource the construction of a factory in Brazil. In December 2024 a government task force rescued 163 Chinese workers from slavery-like conditions. Employees were made to work without protective equipment, 12 hour daily shifts, and threatened with physical violence. Some workers had their passports confiscated and part of their salaries confiscated. 

Could this be an example of the other ""unconventional measures"" alluded to by suppliers above? It almost certainly seems that way.

So what does all of this mean for BYD? Is BYD destined to be the next Evergrande? Is BYD too big to fail?

In the short-to-medium-term BYD probably wont go bankrupt. In the to long-term i think there's increased risk. The thing about the EV market in China is it's extremely competitive. [In 2023 there was 100 different EV manufacturers in China, down from 500 in 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle_industry_in_China) (many of these scams). In the future, probably a dozen or less will remain. And what BYD is doing is accelerating the timeline.

The advantage that BYD has is that it's not just a carmaker, but also one of the biggest national manufacturers of batteries.[ But the battery supply market in China has also been increasingly under pressure in recent years with prices plunging by more than 50% since 2023.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-09/china-s-batteries-are-now-cheap-enough-to-power-huge-shifts)

Yet despite the intense competition in the battery and automotive markets, BYD has repeatedly managed to post record high [gross margins above 20%.](https://cnevpost.com/2025/04/25/byd-earnings-q1-2025/) Margins which are probably only sustainable due to BYD's unethical, sometimes illegal, business practices. But these kinds of underhanded tactics can't last forever and it's possible something could trigger an Evergrande-like event. A record high debt:equity ratio, defaults on its loans, tighter regulations, and an increasingly heated price war all pose a risk. Perhaps that's why Berkshire and Buffett have been quietly cutting their former 10% stake in BYD down to less than 5% last year (under the reporting threshold).

But with a market cap over $150 billion USD, nearly 4 times the peak of Evergrande, it's probably unlikely BYD goes bankrupt. Besides, BYD is too important to China as a national behemoth in the new energy economy. Still it seems unlikely that BYD can continue to grow at the same pace, or maintain it's record high gross margins, if either of those depend on its continued use of unethical business practices outlined above.

And then there's the threat of autonomous driving which could totally revolutionize transport. By all accounts i've seen, Tesla's FSD is the best performing software available in China. IF Tesla's FSD proves to be as good as some expect, the deployment of hundreds of thousands to millions of autonomous taxis could be an extinction level event the entire industry.

Anyway, not financial advice, and i have no idea what will happen to BYD. Personally i wouldn't take a position in BYD in either direction. It's such a massive player in batteries and EVs in China that it may very well be ""too big to fail,"" but that doesn't mean it can't be damaged. More broadly i think both industries will continue to see intense competition in the future and many smaller players will be forced into bankruptcy, mergers, or acquired.

**Jobs Report Comes As Fed Faces Pressure on Interest Rates**  
The scheduled Friday release of the May U.S. jobs report will show whether the labor market continues to exhibit strength after employers added more jobs than analysts expected in April, as the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%.

Trump has been applying pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates from their current levels of 4.25% to 4.5%. Fed officials have said that they are in “wait-and-see” mode as the labor market remains strong and inflation comes under pressure from U.S. tariffs.

Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak, including Federal Reserve Chair Powell, Dallas Fed President Logan, Chicago Fed President Goolsbee, and Philadelphia Fed President Harker. On Wednesday, the Fed’s Beige Book will provide more details on economic conditions throughout the country.

The Thursday scheduled report on the U.S. trade deficit comes as tariff threats have pushed shippers to increase imports ahead of the expected import taxes.

Investors will also be watching manufacturing and services industry surveys scheduled for release this week, as well as updated data on consumer credit levels, factory orders, and construction spending.

**Tech, Retail Earnings Reports in Focus**  
Chipmaker Broadcom’s scheduled financial report, due Thursday, comes on the heels of industry leader Nvidia’s (NVDA) report last week that showed continued demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products. Broadcom reported a 77% jump in its AI-related revenue in its most recent financial release as company executives forecast continued growth in that sector.

Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings is expected to release its earnings on Tuesday. The firm said in early May that it planned to cut 5% of its workforce. Guidewire Software, which provides services to insurance providers, is also expected to deliver an update on its AI products Tuesday.

Logistics software provider Descartes Systems Group is expected to release its earnings on Wednesday. Shippers continue to grapple with the impact of Trump's tariffs on the supply chain.

With consumer sentiment surveys showing increasing concerns over economic conditions, investors will be watching reports from retailers for signals on spending. Scheduled reports from Dollar General on Tuesday and Dollar Tree and Five Below on Wednesday will provide a look at consumer traffic at those stores. Campbell’s scheduled report on Monday will shine a light on food spending, while fashion brands Lululemon and Calvin Klein parent PVH also will be reporting.

2025-05-30,Quantum Scamming Inc: The Big Short Nobody Saw Coming,"Morning fellas, I'm back after more than three years to bring you my highest conviction idea ever. I'm talking 90%+ downside.

**TL;DR:** Quantum computing stocks are the next great meme bubble — a flaming clown car of hype, government grants, and zero actual business. Companies like $QBTS, $IONQ, $RGTI, and especially $QUBT (which literally used to sell flavored beverages) are pretending to be tech plays while burning through cash with nothing to show for it. Even if quantum computing becomes real, Google and IBM already won the arms race. Experts say useful quantum is still 20–30 years away — not 3. This is *The Big Short 2: Quantum Boogaloo*. I’m shorting these frauds before they drop another 90%. Strap in.

**Introduction:**

Quantum stocks ripped aggressively since the beginning of the year, after the announcement of Willow, Google's new quantum processor. First of all, Google didn't even come up with anything groundbreaking. Ironically, this also highlights how far ahead Google is from the competition. Even worse, some of the stocks below don't even make quantum computers at all.

Quantum computing is 20-30y+ away, if at all. Yet the stocks trade like they cured cancer yesterday. This is honestly a lot worse than Nikola and EV stocks for those who were there back then. They are totally misunderstood by retail, and some of them literaly have 90%+ downside.

**Quantum Computing Basics:**

Quantum computing isn't a better computer. It's a compeltely different paradigm that is only useful to solve very specific and esoteric problems. Like factoring big prime numbers (even that doesn't even work yet) or doing weird matrix math *only under certain condtions.*

To run these algorithms, you don't need just a couple qubits, you need error corrected logical qubits, which take *thousands* of physicals qubits. We're barely

One of the biggest issues with quantum computeers is gate fidelity. This measures how a quantum gate actually performs its intended operation compared to an ideal, noise-free version of that gate. Today, even the best systems get around 99.9% fiedlity under perfect lab conditions. This sounds high, but due to the exponential scaling of quantum algorithms, erors compoound extremely quickly and at 99.9% they are literaly useless. Quantum algos need billions of error free operations and we're nowhere closes. For comparisons, classical computers have gate fidelity of between 10^(-15) and 10^(-18). Thats eighteen 9s after 99, or 99.99999999999999999%. Its not that quantum computers are behind classical computers - *they're basically unusable*

**Industry Experts**

Why should you believe me when I say quantum computing doens't work? After all I'm just a muppet. If you don't take my word for it, listen to the leading industry experts, that spend their days working on it.

Scott Aaronson (Professor, UT Austin, top quanutm complexity theorist):  
""We're nowhere near large-scale quantum computers. The real applications are speculative and still a long way off""

Jensen Huang (CEO, NVIDIA):  
""Quantum computing is decades away. It will not replace classical computing. It's a different tool for very specific problems.""

Dr. Isaac Chuang (MIT, pionner in quantum information):  
""Quantum computers are not yet practical, and may not be for a long time. The barriers are fundamental""

Even if all these people are wrong, Google and IBM are so far ahead, that they'll be the clear winners.

**The Trade:**

The most overvalued and ridiculous names are: $QUBT, $QBTS, $IONQ, $RGTI. I'm short only the first two. They're all ridiculous, but at least IONQ and Rigetti have somewhat of a product.

$QUBT: This is literaly a scam, they've got very little to do with Quantum. These guys were literaly a beverage company. They don't build quantum computers. They sell vague ""quantum inspired"" software with 0 commerical traction. They claim to be ""hardware-agnostic"", which literaly reads ""we don't have a machine"". Imagine being a quantum computing stock with no computer. Revenue in 23 was $100k, not millions, $100k. This is not even a real business, just a vehicule made to earn a quick buck. Their software doens't even require a qaumtum processor to run, it's just classical code with buzzwords. This is my highest conviction short.

$QBTS: These guys make quantum annealers, not even a real quantum computer. They've een in business for 25 years, and only make $9m in revenue, with a market cap of $4.7bn. They were on the brink of bankruptcy, trading for $1, with no cash left. Then the Willow anouncement came and they manage to issue some stock and get some cash back. As a reminder, Willow has nothing to do with QBTS, this will end going back to 0 after the hype subsides.

Earlier this month, CEO Elon Musk said the EV maker is set to begin a test of its long-promised robotaxi service on schedule in Austin, Texas, by the end of June.

A successful robotaxi trial is crucial for Tesla as Musk has shifted the company's focus away from building a new, cheaper EV platform to launching the robotaxi service and its Optimus humanoid robots. Much of Tesla's valuation hangs on that bet.

In a new move to hinder China’s development of advanced semiconductor chips, the Trump administration has reportedly instructed U.S. companies that provide software used in semiconductor design to cease sales to Chinese entities, according to a report by the Financial Times on Wednesday. The directive was issued by the Bureau of Industry and Security, a division of the U.S. commerce department that supervises export controls.

The companies affected by this directive include Electronic Design Automation (EDA) groups such as Cadence, Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS), and Siemens (ETR:SIEGn) EDA. It remains uncertain if all U.S. EDA companies received this instruction.

An official is said to have confirmed that the commerce department is currently evaluating exports of strategic importance to China. During this review, some existing export licenses have been suspended or additional license requirements have been imposed, the official reportedly added.

Trying to wrap my head around Novo Nordisk’s face-plant. The ADR (NVO) peaked around the $140s last June and now languishes in the mid-60s — a **-50% drawdown** even after today’s little bounce. I’m not seeing a single “Lehman moment,” so what’s really driving the exodus?

A few breadcrumbs I’ve picked up, but none of them *feel* big enough alone:

* **CEO ouster:** Board pushed out long-time CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen this month, blaming the share-price slide and loss of GLP-1 momentum. Succession search is on. 
* **Head-to-head data vs. Lilly:** NEJM study showed Lilly’s Zepbound beating Wegovy for weight-loss efficacy; NVO got clipped another few % that day. 
* **Price-war pressure:** Novo slashed Ozempic/Wegovy list prices after Lilly undercut with $349 direct-sale pricing, sparking worries margins will compress.
* **Growth decel + bearish notes:** Q1 sales still up \~16 % Y/Y but slower than the 30-40 % we saw in 2023; DBS even slapped a *sell* on the name. 

Questions for the hive mind:

1. **Is the market pricing in a long-term erosion of GLP-1 dominance** (manufacturing capacity, oral competitors, price caps)?
2. **Does the CEO switch signal deeper strategic issues** or is it just optics? The Novo Nordisk Foundation still controls the vote.
3. **How bad could margin compression get** if Wegovy/Ozempic turn into a low-price slug-fest?
4. Anyone tracking *pipeline vs. patent cliff* timing here? Is there a sleeper drug that could re-ignite the story like semaglutide did?

2025-05-27,Google's search share falls below 90% - is AI the new king of search?,"Looks like the *innovators dilemma* is finally catching up with Google. After a decade of near-absolute dominance, its grip on the global search market is finally showing real cracks.   
Google’s global search share dropped to 89%, marking the first sustained dip below 90% since 2015.  
This isn’t just a blip. For past year it has hovered in the under 90% range, signaling a real trend as users shift their habits. What is driving this change?

**Users want answers, not ads pretending to be answers**  

**Users want real solutions to complex problems, not blue links**  

**People are done scrolling through SEO sludge and digging through link farms. Just get straight to the point dammit!**

*Clayton Christensen’s* theory of disruptive innovation is highly relevant to Google’s current situation and Google knows it. The theory highlights that disruption thrives when new entrants redefine value propositions. Google’s creation of Alphabet in 2015 exemplifies a structural solution to this dilemma. By splitting into autonomous subsidiaries (e.g., Waymo, Verily, DeepMind), Google insulated disruptive projects from the financial pressures of its core search business, allowing them to experiment with moonshot ideas without immediate ROI expectations. They tried very hard.....but the gig is up!

A couple of decades ago, when browsers were still relevant, Microsoft won the browser wars but were disrupted by Google which redefined search as the starting value proposition for the internet. Now the AI native competitors - think Perplexity, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Grok etc - are gaining traction at a very high speed.

The stock price is where it was over a year ago. Even after the recent rally, it is still trading below the 55 & 200 day averages on the daily chart. And there is a bearish RSI divergence on the weeklies. 

AI search is eating Google's lunch. Thoughts?

The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[ a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html) in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.

Ahead of the [company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) — formed what would come to be known as the [""Magnificent Seven.""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)

The group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[ three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.

As of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.

From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.

Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

In comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

2025-05-26,Dollar under pressure as tariffs start to stir things up again,"he U.S. dollar is testing a couple of key support levels as the market is clearly getting restless again over tariff uncertainty. Traders are more or less reminiscent of the U.S.-China trade war. Although it is not 2019, but the “familiar tension” is back.



Recent analysis and current tariff policy:

U.S. bond yields fell a little bit, the dollar less interest rate support, coupled with the market for the second half of this year rate cuts are still expected (such as September or November), no one dares to bet on the Fed to raise interest rates again!

President Trump's threat to impose tariffs of 25% to 50% on iPhones made in China has prompted Apple to accelerate plans to move production lines to India and Trump's announcement that he will impose tariffs of 50% on European Union imports starting July 9, after imposing a 10% “reciprocal” tariff on EU goods.



Market Reaction and Economic Impact:

Market Volatility: The Trump administration's tariffs have triggered sharp swings in global markets.

Slowdown in economic growth: High tariffs could dampen economic growth and lead to a decrease in government tax revenues. In addition, companies may reduce the impact of tariffs by avoiding them or adjusting their supply chains, further undermining the effectiveness of the tariff policy

So, all in all It's not that the dollar is going to collapse, but if trade policy continues to be ambiguous and macro data is not strong, then the dollar may continue to dip in the short term



My point of concern:

DXY support around 104 - if it breaks down here, then there could be a real downward move.

The EURUSD is strengthening and commodities (e.g. gold) are slowly moving higher in a classic “dollar under pressure” configuration. Unless Powell has something new to say in his next speech, it will probably be a lower week.



My summary:

The dollar has been a bit of a bear lately.

Tariff uncertainty is making the market nervous.

Markets are generally conservative , watch the DXY and safe-haven asset movements.

2025-05-25,"Repost of my DD for VVX, $1.5B company with over $15 billion in defense contracts and 50% institutional ownership","I'm dumb and I didn't know I had to post screenshots of my positions and so it got taken down. So here is my dd again with my positions as well. I bought on Friday morning after doing some research on Thursday night at $45.87/share and now its $45.42. Let me know if I need anything else.

VVX (V2X Inc.) is a defense and government services contractor that basically helps the military manage their bases by providing logistics, cyber security, training, and aerospace solutions. It is currently trading around $48 but here is why I think it can at least double its value by the end of the year.

**1. Steady revenue stream from multiple government contracts**

1. $3.7 Billion – U.S. Army Warfighter Training Readiness Solutions [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html) 
2. $11.9 Billion JETS 2.0 Contract [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html) 

These are just two biggest ones and there are many many more here if you interested [https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./](https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./) This shows that VVX has a lot of revenue laid out in the next few years and still has even more room to grow as they take on more contracts. And because these are government contracts, there is a high renewal chance on these contracts which means recurring revenue streams.

**2. High institutional ownership** 

According to Dow Jones Institutional News, institutions own around 16,015,893 shares of VVX. Given that VVX has around 31.68 million shares outstanding, this means institutions own about 50% which suggest a strong foundation in the company.

While I would like to put a link to this, I got this news from my broker so if you use interactive brokers, you can find the news there or maybe your broker has the news too. But here are the shares that some of the institutions hold for reference:

Fidelity Management & Research 3.2 m

BlackRock 1.5m

FIAM LLC 1.5m

Vanguard 896k

**3. Business stability**

This company has been around for over a decade and has been formed via a merger of Vectrus and Vertex in 2022 so this is not just a flashy start up that will die down. They operate in over 50 countries and employs around 16,000 people with the majority of those people being veterans(another plus for a defense company)

**4. Low Volume**

This is a double edged sword as low volume can indicate a bearish sentiment on the stock. However, considering how VVX only has a 7% short interest and high institutional ownership I believe that this is not the case.

In fact, I think its just that there is no sentiment because no one knows about this stock. The average daily volume is 270k which is very very small compared to other companies with such a good foundation. There hasn’t been any reddit posts or any mention of the stock on the news and the few youtube videos that exist have less than 50 views. This means that its a stock has has been completely missed by retail investors and has a huge potential to grow once people start looking at the stock. 

**Now here is the downside as well:**

Their PE ratio is currently around 36, which is high for a defense contractor. However, I believe this is temporary.

VVX recently landed several multi-billion-dollar government contracts. In the early stages of fulfilling these contracts, the company invests heavily in systems, infrastructure, and personnel — expenses that reduce short-term profits.

Once the initial setup is complete, these costs drop significantly while revenue continues, which should lead to a much lower PE ratio and stronger earnings.

In fact, their net income has already grown 608% YoY, showing that profitability is trending in the right direction.

**Future Catalysts**

* Next earnings report showing increased income by reducing costs
* More large contract awards (they’ve already landed over $15B+ in just the past year)
* Initiation of analyst coverage or ETF inclusion
* More attention from retail investors

**TL;DR**

* VVX is a defense contractor with with $4.3B revenue and 50% institutional ownership
* It trades at low volume (\~270k/day), has almost zero retail awareness, and has landed over $15B in multiyear government contract over the past year
* Could easily 2x by the end of the year once the market catches on

At the beginning of April, the analyst consensus for NVDA’s Q1 EPS was an average of $0.93 per share, up from $0.89 in Q4. NVDA’s EPS has increased QoQ since 2022, when both Q2 and Q3 EPS were $0.03, down from $0.06 in Q1. The image below shows the trend and revisions for analysts’ EPS estimates this quarter.

https://preview.redd.it/2cew4jyvet2f1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=9583d6f1ac0e6d4f870e6da9b8329198681e3e99

The current average estimate is around $0.73 within a week of the release. **That is a decrease of over 20% from the previous consensus, and calls for NVDA’s first decline in EPS QoQ since 2022.** So what’s causing this massive shift in expectations?

People will quickly cite the $5.5 billion charge “for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves” as the reason for such a drop, **which is completely wrong.**

The charge will almost certainly be listed as a GAAP Non-Operating Expense, meaning that the Non-GAAP expense segments should be minimally impacted. Headlines report the non-GAAP EPS number, meaning the downward revisions have more to do with the indirect impacts of the China export ban and other trade controls, rather than the direct $5.5 billion charge.

A deeper look into the estimates will show that data center revenue and data center margin have seen the most significant negative revisions. The revisions come in response to the H20 ban, which resulted in a loss of 2 weeks of sales in China, and changed the product mix as a % of sales in the quarter.

These are two negative impacts on profitability, with sales and margin on those sales both seeing steep declines. However, it appears analysts may be overestimating how much revenue was lost from those two weeks in China, and may have completely misunderstood how margins will be impacted entirely.

According to Business Daily, China sales represented 13% of NVDA’s revenue last year, and the share of sales in China has been trending down. Since 2 weeks of a 13 week quarter is about 15% of the total time, and about 13% of revenue from that two weeks is gone, basic math tells us Data Center Revenue should decrease by roughly 2%.

My initial estimate was $41.0 billion, and decreasing it by 2% would amount to about $40.2 billion. Analyst consensus is sitting around $38.5 billion according to Nasdaq(dot)com, an increase of only 8.1% QoQ. Below is a graph of Data Center Revenue for the past 11 quarters, shown in blue, with the red point being analyst estimates for the current quarter.

[The Consensus is a massive slowdown this quarter](https://preview.redd.it/2rosyfazet2f1.png?width=1967&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4715f993863c35850b5e96c315e0c5a05e12a7d)

As for the impact on gross margin, analysts have revised their estimates down due to the shift in product mix without the H20 chips and other China products.

According to Yahoo Finance, H20 chips were estimated in the 50% range for margins, and their recent strength actually put downward pressure on margins. This means it is unlikely that the new product mix has a significantly lower margin than pre-H20 ban.

The company-issued guidance for gross margin in the current quarter is 71%, with the average analyst now expecting 68.4% according to CMC Markets.

Since the total revenue average estimate is $43.1 billion, and $38.5 billion is data center revenue, we know the other three segments are estimated to contribute $4.6 billion to total revenue.

I estimate $4.2 billion from the remaining segments, but a higher gross margin using 71% from company-issued guidance.

So, how much distance is between my estimates and the analysts’ estimates? Well, analysts are currently expecting $43.1 billion in revenue and 68.4% gross margin, while I anticipate at least $44.3 billion and 71% margins. The product of those numbers is the profit before subtracting Operating and Non-Operating Expenses, and dividing by shares outstanding.

**I have $31.453 billion, while the analyst consensus is $29.48 billion, which is almost $2 billion lower.**

Even if expenses come in higher than the company-issued guidance, analysts have sandbagged expectations going into the print. I expect a massive “surprise” beat on earnings day.

**Most importantly, a large beat still may not be priced in, even after the pre-earnings rally. The stock is still around the same price it was going into last quarter’s print. If we see QoQ earnings growth beating estimates, I believe investors will take the stock higher, while if this is all a pipe dream and earnings do decline, we could stay rangebound or worse.**

* One day after,on Thursday morning, April 10, 2025, Trump clarified that tariffs on Chinese imports would be even higher than expected, reversing prior gains and dragging SPY down 4 % ish ( at some point).

Digging deeper, below is an analysis of Trump Announcements impacts ( only the 50 ish most relevant , summary table below) on the Stock Market since January 2025 up to mid May 2025, or an average of 2.5 meaningful announcement per week since January 20, 2025; or \~17 weeks ). Index prices (NYSE composite and SPY) and sectorial ETFs were mainly analyzed. For SPY, data output and overall reaction is a bit skewed toward magnificent seven and IT sector reaction given their weight and market cap.

Some Redditors asked about how impact is assessed. This involved lot of data scraping and adjustments to isolate the effect of the news. Typically, after an announcement, I tend to analyze the index direction 24 hours prior to identify the pre-existing trend, which could come from a general event or another Trump announcement. Then, I examine the index performance 24 hours post announcement (mostly from the last close to the closing price at the day of the announcement or to a specific trading hour). So, if Trump reverses a policy within three trading sessions for instance, the broader NYSE composite index's variance may initially seem minor (1 to 3 %) over plus or minus few trading sessions, as to cancel previous decision impact and due to its overall composition, a basket of sectors (defensive, cyclical, etc..). However, when zooming on sectors or stocks highly sensitive to specific announcements, the material impact can be isolated. And after the analysis, once I find a trend, I use the help of Grok, Chat GPT, Claude (latest updates are very strong in analyzing complex data) and Gemini to analyze the raw data and see if they intersect with my pattern analysis.

At first, I thought Fridays were the worst, because a surprise announcement over the weekend could hurt my investments when markets reopen Monday but the analysis didn’t fully confirm that. What is certain though is that a Friday announcement late in the day, or early Monday morning can seriously mess up a trading plan if you have a significant dollar exposure.

Let’s see if his next announcements fit the pattern in the upcoming weeks and beyond until he decides to retire from presidency..I will be updating this monthly and include also impact on options prices

Positive impacts:

* Defense, private prison, and energy sectors often saw gains after border, military, and energy policy announcements.
* Tech stocks benefited from deregulation, AI investments, and new councils focusing on science/technology.
* Tariff announcements had mixed but generally sector-specific positive impacts on U.S. producers.
* Cryptocurrency and memecoin promotions caused spikes in crypto-related stocks.

Negative impacts:

* Broad market dips often followed announcements around tariffs on imports and federal aid halts.
* Healthcare and education sectors were negatively affected by funding cuts and bans.
* Renewable energy and EV-related stocks dropped when Trump reversed Biden-era environmental policies.
* Consumer goods stocks occasionally dipped due to tariff threats and trade tensions.

Neutral/Minimal impact:

* Social and political announcements like pardons and symbolic declarations usually had minimal stock market impact.
* Some federal policy reversals had muted or negligible effects on broader markets.

 **Typical Market Reaction Patterns**

* Morning announcements (9:00–11:00 AM EST):
   * Often involved regulatory changes, new councils, or executive orders.
   * Markets reacted positively to innovation-related announcements (AI, crypto) and negatively to funding cuts.
* Afternoon announcements (12:00–7:00 PM EST):
   * Frequently focused on enforcement actions, tariffs, and emergency declarations.
   * Mixed market reactions: defense and energy up, consumer and manufacturing stocks down.
* Day of week trends:
   * Monday: Multiple impactful policy announcements; mixed market reactions with slight dips due to policy uncertainty.
   * Tuesday & Wednesday: High frequency of tariffs, funding cuts, and enforcement announcements; often negative or sector-specific impacts.
   * Thursday: Mostly enforcement, immigration, and defense-related announcements; moderate positive impact on defense.
   * Friday: Mixed, including sanctions, crypto promotions, and layoffs; markets generally down or flat.
   * Saturday & Sunday: Few announcements, mostly symbolic or enforcement-related with limited market impact.

Most mid week news (Wednesday and thursday) seem to be the catalysts for SPY trend pattern confirmation or reversal.

Honestly i haven’t seen a lot of quality discussion about the planned robotaxi launch in June. Otherthan bulls and bears yelling on each other and random meme shit. 
Let’s collect all the facts and try to find what’s gonna happen in few weeks. 

Here are some facts we know so far and i will try to be impartial as i can be and just state facts and not my opinion. 
- Elon announced robotaxi planned launch in Austin in June. 
- TSLA stock has rallied 40+ % since the announcement. 
- TSLA sales are being disastrous worldwide and on going sales news are negative. Hence making the stock rally purely based on hopium on robotaxi launch. 
- TSLA FSD is currently at level-2 autonomy. 
- Full autonomy with driver less operation is level-5. 
- Tsla uses a complete vision based system. vs competitors multiple sensors including LIDAR and Radars. 
- We haven’t seen any test vehicles or any tests happening around robotaxi despite launch date being just few weeks away. (Waymo did years of testing before making their service publicly available)
- On the otherside, tsla fans seems to be seeing all the current fsd being driven by consumers are actual test and that is good enough for fsd launch. 

That’s all for now. Let’s discuss and as we go we can add more points and if possible we can keep this as a long thread to keep track the planned event.

[Investing.com](http://Investing.com) \-- Shares of Informatica (NYSE: INFA) surged over 20% today after reports emerged that Salesforce (NYSE: NYSE:CRM) is in renewed talks to acquire the cloud data management firm. The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.

According to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.

The movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce’s dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.

As the talks are private, the details remain speculative, and the companies have not issued any official statements regarding the potential acquisition. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ktskpw/informatica_soars_23_as_salesforce_reportedly/,wallstreetbets,"Informatica soars 23% as Salesforce reportedly revives acquisition talks.

2025-05-22,GLD Puts and here’s why,"Position GLD put @ 305 July

Gold has had a remarkable run during all this crazyness. Up 25% YTD and 38% in the last year. While long term I would t bet against gold but this increase is insane. Gold has been touted as a inflationary hedge as well as a stabilizing investment when fear is high. The primary consensus on the bull run for gold is the uncertainty of stocks and then uncertainty of bonds. Long term yields have continued to climb for US treasuries and this is why I believe Gold is going to come back down.
Institutional investors want certainty where they can get it. US treasuries is a relatively risk free investment that is now paying a premium. My belief is we are going to see a massive shift from the GLD into longer term US treasuries as yield start to peak. This is not what is the better investment it is about risk management. Portfolio managers have been buying short term treasuries because long term treasuries have been dog shit for yields because everyone expected rates to go down by now. The yield inversion caused massive amounts of money to stay in short term treasuries because it created by comparison risk exposure to long term treasuries. We are seeing that risk play out right now. Long term yields are rising because the downgrade and also short term rates have stayed elevated past their expected time frame. 
Like everything this comes down to timing. I picked July because my hope is the trade crap is at least calmed. We find our inflation ain't so bad. Unemployment has gone up enough for the fed to start signaling rate cuts.

2025-05-22,Unpopular opinion on DWAVE(QBTS),"So here is the deal guys, I have been doing some research into D-Wave and here is what I would like to share with the entire community.

Let me start with the very basic and something everyone knows already( I hope) they are in the quantum industry, currently there are 6000+ devoting they time in some sort of quantum research, of those 6000, “only”  513 are pure-play ,  D-Wave is part of the later, so 1/513.

….Yes its a crowded space.

First lets talk about the fundamentals (in the end its all about that anyway)

Last year they made 8M of revenue and spend 75M, so they lost almost 70M in 2024. Simple maths so far right. In terms of Price/earnings (the famous P/E)  is non, zero, nada, and thats ok for a new company, specially in the early stages. Right?

Wrong they exist since 1999, yes you hear that right, 25+ years and since they started operations they were never profitable. 25 years old company. …Let that sink in.

Now some red flags are becoming clear, but hey lets calm down, 1 ratio is not enough to give the big picture, one must have a “helicopter view”.

2024 Price to Book (P/B)=35.22 For comparison the average price for a Nasdaq100 company is 4.56.  And yes the most valued companies in the world (Apple/Googles…etc) are almost 8 times cheaper than D-Wave. And they (Apple,microsoft…et al)are not the cheapest stock to own by any means.

Ok so P/E and P/B are screaming red flags, lets have a look at EV/Revenue as a better metric since it takes into consideration debt and cash on hand, and not only Market Cap.

2024 EV/Revenue is a whopping…wait for it…241 2024  D-Wave EV/Revenue=241, you guys have any idea of how hard this? Again, for comparison the average Nasdaq 100 company sits at just 6.84 Crazy right?…

But wait there more… 2024 Price to sales (P/S)=154  this basically means that for $1 they get in revenue they need to spend $154+ For comparison, the average Nasdaq100 company sits at 2.85.

Let me get this straight:  D-Wave is 75 x expensive that the most valuable companies in the world (and again, those companies are not cheap to own)

Am sorry to be repetitive, but I have to say it again: D-Wave is 75x more EXPENSIVE than the MOST VALUABLE COMPANIES in the WORLD.

U guys know how much dilution occur last year? 260M, 266,595,867 if u wanna be precise.

They are laughing at us retailers while cashing millions and providing for their families, and you guys allow that to happen by buying a laughing stock.

It’s a JOKE!!!!

Yes, revenue increased 500% in last Q, they sold a single computer for 13M and they did not disclose how long it take them to build(wondering why?). Allow me to explain why, on average it takes 3-5 years, lets be optimistic here and assume the best scenario, lets say they made it in 2 years, world record (and remember if they did that, they would be bragging on the media).

The second important question would be, how much it cost them? Well they did not disclose as always. Well, if u take again the best case scenario, and imagine that they build in the last 2 years, it cost 79.3M(2023) + 75.6M (2024) thats the amount they lost in the last 2 years, but this includes everything (COGS: Cost of Good sold, General and Administrative Expenses, R&D,Selling & Marketing)

By the way, you know what they spend those 155M of expenses ending 2024 and 2023? Its all salaries, 85% to be more precise.

35% its all for administration and high management salaries, 25% for the research and development team salaries 15% was just for PPE and the last 10% was on marketing.

In other words they spend more on high management than in R&D. You know how CRAZYY this is?

And one more thing…
Last night the CEO is dumping 14,3M shares of the stock after pumping the stock price a day to an all time high with the release 
of a new QC Advantage2, let me repeat this so that it really sinks in.
The CEO of DWave is dumping almost x2 the amount the company made in Revenue as I post this

This was allowed to go public via a SPAC, the biggest scam in modern history of investing. Am not going to go into details but please kindly do ur own research.

Oh and in the mean time theres no dividend, because…duhhhhhh!!!!

(Bloomberg) — The Trump administration will maintain efforts to keep advanced artificial intelligence technology out of China’s hands, a top White House official said, brushing off calls from Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world’s second largest economy.

“We obviously have huge respect for Jensen,” Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. “When it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they’re physically inside” the country, he added.

While the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang’s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created “GPU haves and GPU have nots.”

“When it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,” Krishnan said. “On that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.”

Krishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a “failure” and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.

Huang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. “China has 50% of the world’s AI developers, and it’s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,” he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.

Krishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump’s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies’ access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.

“These deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,” said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. “Most of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ks6hod/us_to_keep_china_chip_curbs_spurning_nvidias_call/,wallstreetbets,"US to keep China chip curbs, spurning Nvidia’s call for relief.

2025-05-19,408K YOLO INTO $IOVA,"Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:

**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.

**Reasons:**

1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.
2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.
3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.

https://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445

4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.

https://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b

5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.

https://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0

6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.

7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.

8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.

9. CEO Dr. Fred Vogt bought 25k shares last week on the open market for the first time. Management is not that great at communicating, but company fundamentals are strong and this is a sign of faith.

https://preview.redd.it/faixn1a8zr1f1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b04b84e99359cf2fd5b462c70a17ee1ca6e5a90

10. Management dropping guidance after realizing it takes a bit longer for treatment centers to bring in patients sucks only if you bought before they dropped it (and the stock tanks 45%). Now, with a far more conservative guidance, management has far more room to outperform. In Q2, guidance should be easily met given what management said in the earnings call.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

1. ASCO 2025 conference, where will discuss results of a few clinical trials + host round table with experts.
2. Q2 Earnings where treatment results should normalize.
3. European expansion should be announced in the next few months.

**Positions:** 238 thousand shares at $1.73 average price.

https://preview.redd.it/5ykwiwsp5s1f1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe762876d9bb0057ec2ef9d78da9a5b6609b8f8c

**Conclusion:**

$IOVA is very cheaply priced, is a leader in one of the most exciting technologies in healthcare, and has an FDA approved life-saving drug. **Price target: 10$.**

Let me know your thoughts. I think stock was quite risky a few weeks ago (and more so a few years ago) - now I believe risk-reward one of the most attractive out there. This is not financial advice. Pray for me.

**Edit 1:** There are a number of class action lawsuits because the stock dropped 45% after Q1 earnings due to management lowering guidance + manufacturing maintenance impacting revenue. If you look at the earnings calls for the past few quarters, there was indeed poor communication + too much optimism, but it is hard to argue that this is fraud - especially given the fact that management is just rolling out the drug, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, infusions are bouncing back and there is strong demand. The stock dropping 45% is not good for previous shareholders, but it is very good for new buyers.

**Edit 2:** I am not a bag-holder, I just recently entered the stock. One notable bag holder is billionaire biotech investor Wayne Rothbaum (who sits on the board) though!

**Edit 3:** Outdated info but short interest is \~27% of float with 9 days to cover. Institutional ownership is 83.18%.

**Edit 4:** I have not sold a single share, and do not plan on selling until stock approaches my price target, or unless there is a material adverse development related to the company. Time horizon is 0.5-2 years.

**Edit 5:** Here is an excellent video from the Director of Melanoma Medical Oncology at the Stanford Cancer Center discussing the therapy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvr10OA_DJc.

**Edit 6:** FDA positive positioning + increased insider buying from new CCO + positive outlook at ASCO along with impressive 5 year survival data allowed the stock to rally to 2.2. I have not sold a single share, and added a bit more a week ago as I truly believe this is just the beginning. Currently holding 250,000+ shares, and will not consider selling until either the stock hits my target price or there is a material event that shakes my confidence.

2025-05-19,What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI,"This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.

To put this into perspective, thats:

* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks
* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips
* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**
* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7

As you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?

First, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.

DCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it’s SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**

Additionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.

Traditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:

* 1U and 2U server chassis
* Motherboards
* Power supplies
* GPU trays

Customers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That’s low-margin business, because you’re selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:

* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)
* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)
* Network switches
* Rack management software
* Power distribution units (PDUs)

Why does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:

|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|
|:-|:-|
|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|
|$5K–$15K ASP/server|$250K–$2M ASP per rack|
|6–10% gross margin|**15–25%+ gross margin**|
|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|

Now lets go more in depth:

**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**

* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K–$50K** each.
* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64–96 GPUs) sell for **$2–5 million per rack**.
* Even if gross margins stay in the 8–10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40×–80× higher** than per-server sales.

Higher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.

**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**

With DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it’s delivering:

* 8–12 liquid-cooled GPU servers
* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month
* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)
* Power delivery + networking
* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration
* Software/BIOS optimization

All of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:

1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components
2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services
3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles

**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**

SMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3–4 weeks**, while others take 8–12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.

For hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.

For example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:

* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs
* 3–4 month delay in deploying AI training models
* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers

Below is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:

|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**SMCI**|**\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3–4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|
|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\~6–10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|
|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\~8–12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|
|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|

This “time-value” premium enhances margin per contract.

**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**

Clients benefit from:

* 30–50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)
* Higher rack density → fewer racks → less real estate
* Reduced HVAC burden → capex + opex savings

Because DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80–100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack — which:

* Makes SMCI’s per-rack offering more economically valuable
* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive

Higher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin

**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**

SMCI is building out:

* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia
* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly

This allows SMCI to:

* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling
* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume
* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity

Economies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit → rising margin

Below is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:

|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|
|:-|:-|
|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|
|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|
|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|
|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO → preserves SMCI pricing power|
|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|

So far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.

Now to the fun part: The UAE Deal

After doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:

|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|
|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|
|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|
|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|
|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|
|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|
|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|

As you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.

**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**

This wasn’t a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:

**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**

* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.
* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build — suggesting up to 25% is plausible.

**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**

* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2–4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.
* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.

**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**

* SMCI can output \~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.
* To hit 50–100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they’d need to commit 6–12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.

**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**

* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10–25% is well within reach.

**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**

* SMCI’s lead time (3–4 weeks vs. 8–12 weeks) is a massive advantage.
* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** — but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.

I think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:

[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)



All in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.

TL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.

2025-05-18,$30K On UNH Calls.  Here’s Why The Stock Could Fly:,"Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).

My new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH

I have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.

In no particular order:

1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here’s a breakdown of the key transactions:

• Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.

• Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290

• John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648

• Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.

“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” — Charlie Munger

No better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.

2. JIM CRAMER IS BEARISH:  Presented without comment (https://x.com/jimcramer/status/1923018153350631806?s=46&t=zA11beG1ZvqVrorBODhs-g)

3.  DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn 

Furthermore, even if the case isn’t dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don’t really care.

4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:

- Covers 50 million people
- $410B in annual revenues 
- 400,000 employees
- 90,000 doctors in the network

Said differently:  Too Big To Fail.

5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.

6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.

7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.

8.  FUNDAMENTALS ATTRACTIVE:  Wall Street will probably coalesce around EPS of $28 for 2026.  If you use a conservative MCO (Managed Care Org.) multiple of 13x, this gets you a PT of $364.  I think this is a conservative estimate.

9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).

10.  MEMES GONNA MEME:  With soft macro data showing the economy is likely slowing, I believe retail investors are more determined than ever to try to ride the wave of the next meme to outpace any broader economic slowdown whether it be a result of stagflation, job losses, or anything else ""out of their control"".  With large institutions dumping UNH, this is the perfect opportunity for the Regular Joe to accumulate a position in one of the most important companies in America at a massive discount.  I think the rocket ship has only just taken off.  

I could be wrong about all of this and UNH continues to tank.  This is not financial advice.  I'm gonna shoot my shot.  Good luck out there.",https://i.redd.it/y4tr7v7tnk1f1.jpeg,wallstreetbets,"$30K On UNH Calls.  Here’s Why The Stock Could Fly:.

2025-05-18,Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Is Set to Speak at Computex Sunday—What You Need To Know,"Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to take the stage this Sunday at Computex, an annual technology trade show, with this year’s theme—“AI Next”—focused squarely on the emerging technology that has lately powered growth in the company's business.

Huang’s keynote, which will be livestreamed from Taipei’s Music Center at 11 p.m. ET Sunday, is expected to highlight Nvidia’s latest advances, and may bring announcements of new partnerships.

Shares of the AI chipmaker’s stock were little changed Friday. They’ve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals. The recent gains have helped Nvidia shares edge back into positive territory for the year. The potential for new announcements at Computex could present another catalyst for the stock, along with the company's first-quarter earnings report due May 28.

At last year’s Computex, Nvidia had announced the successor to its Blackwell AI chip, known as Rubin, sending shares higher. Huang in March said Rubin is still set to launch in 2026.

""We would expect relatively positive news on the AI front out of Computex next week,"" Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Friday.

Other chipmakers are also scheduled to present later in the week, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) set to showcase its latest developments on Tuesday.

**Retail Chain Reports in Focus Amid Tariff Questions**

Investors will watch retail earnings for signs of consumer weakening amid reports of declining sentiment and concerns that tariffs could drive prices higher. Several noteworthy tech, travel, and medical companies are also on this week’s calendar.

Home Depot’s scheduled report for Tuesday comes after the hardware retailer's weaker-than-expected outlook in the previous quarter, even as its quarterly results topped analyst estimates. The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected comparable store sales growth below 1% also undershot estimates.

Rival hardware seller Lowe’s expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its guidance for 2025 came in under Visible Alpha estimates.

The expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Discount retailer TJX's scheduled Wednesday report comes as the TJ Maxx parent also delivered a disappointing outlook for the quarter just ended, while rival discount chain Ross Stores is on Thursday’s calendar along with fashion brand Ralph Lauren.

Cybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks is expected to report on Tuesday after its last quarterly results were boosted by AI adoption, including cloud investment and infrastructure modernization. Cloud software provider Snowflake’s report, scheduled for Wednesday, comes as it also reported strong results on demand for AI products in the prior period.

International travel service provider [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) and Irish airline Ryanair are on Monday’s corporate calendar, which, along with Tuesday’s report from cruise line Viking, will give investors insight into consumer travel demand.

Investors will also be following Wednesday’s expected release from XPeng, a Chinese electric vehicle maker that competes with Tesla (TSLA) in that country. Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.

**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**

Several Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank’s decisions to keep interest rates unchanged. The Fed has said it is monitoring the economic impact of tariffs as it reviews incoming data on inflation and the labor market.

An Atlanta Federal Reserve event on Monday and Tuesday will feature Fed Vice Chair Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Bostic, Dallas Fed President Logan, San Francisco Fed President Daly, and Cleveland Fed President Hammack. Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.

Market watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as home sales have been sluggish amid high interest rates and challenging inventory.

Investors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kphrm2/what_to_expect_in_the_markets_this_week_may_1923/,wallstreetbets,"What To Expect in the Markets This Week: May 19-23, 2025. >No paywall: [https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-in-the-markets-this-week-11734954](https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-in-the-markets-this-week-11734954)

The plan is to use about 75 lakhs INR for downpayment 2 years from now and the remaining to pay home loan EMIs over a preiod of 5 - 10 years. The financial planner i worked with suggested to keep the 3 Crs in liquid funds and then use most of it to fund the house purchase and reduce the loan amount.

1) 75 lakhs in Kotak/Tata/Invesco Arbitrage funds (not sure if i should go for HDFC Income + Arbitrage FoF instead)

2) 75 Lakhs in HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund (has limited downside protection with debt instruments and so I can drawdown from this over a 2 - 5 year period from now to payback EMIs of the home loan faster)

3) 1.5 Cr in PPFAS Flexi Cap - for a 5 - 10 year horizon to pay back the loan. I may gradually draw down from this as the timeline gets closer and shift partially to an arbitrage fund/debt fund based on taxation at the time.

Generally speaking, there is no best stock, or fund, or bank, or brokerage, or investment platform.

Answers are always subjective to your personal needs, but use those threads a starting point for you to look at what other Redditors have to say about a company, product, fund, or service.

You can then ask a more specific question about what product or service to buy, once you are able to frame your personal situation.

**NOTE** If your question is _I got 10k INR, what do I do to get most returns out of it?_, or anything similar; there is no single answer to this question. But we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to provide some sort of answer:

- How old are you?
- Are you employed/making income?
- How much? What are your objectives with this money?
- Do you have any loan, or big expense coming up?
- What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know it's 100% safe?)
- What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Have you invested in equity before?)
- Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Partner pushing you to spend more?
- What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
- Any big debts?
- Any other relevant financial information about you, that will be useful to give you an informed response.

So, I tried again after 20 minutes. This time the policy was issued successfully. 

Following the payment second time, I got two emails with successful policy twice. I re-checked and found that I have been issued two policies. 

I checked the ""here"" app by HDFC and they only show one policy. 

I sent them an email and they confirmed two policies have been issued to me. I have tried explaining how things went but I get a generic AI / copy-paste response giving me a link or cancellation procedure. 

The issue here is that their way of cancellation means I will not be issued a full refund. Since this was misguided by them and is their mistake, I would like a full refund.

Tried talking to them on phone. I cannot seem to bypass the AI. Can't get a hold on any customer care executive.

Answers are always subjective to your personal needs, but use those threads a starting point for you to look at what other Redditors have to say about a company, product, fund, or service.

You can then ask a more specific question about what product or service to buy, once you are able to frame your personal situation.

**NOTE** If your question is _I got 10k INR, what do I do to get most returns out of it?_, or anything similar; there is no single answer to this question. But we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to provide some sort of answer:

- How old are you?
- Are you employed/making income?
- How much? What are your objectives with this money?
- Do you have any loan, or big expense coming up?
- What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know it's 100% safe?)
- What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Have you invested in equity before?)
- Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Partner pushing you to spend more?
- What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
- Any big debts?
- Any other relevant financial information about you, that will be useful to give you an informed response.

2025-05-31,Help me sanity check my financial life and 1 lakh in monthly investments.,"1. 28 years old. Monthly gross salary is ~2.95 lakhs.

2. I have an education loan at 7.7% interest, 8 year term, 24 lakh rupee principle. The EMI comes out to ~35,000 per month. It's an unsecured loan.

3. I have 1 crore in health insurance and 3 crore in term life insurance until the age of 50. I also have 5 lakhs in group term health insurance and 50 lakhs in group term life insurance through my employer.

4. I have a high risk tolerance, no dependents, parents are self sufficient for the next 10 years at least.

5. My investment horizon is 22 years because I want to retire at 50.

6. My current portfolio is ~12 lakhs, largely in index funds and across a hodgepodge of mutual funds. I've stopped all SIPs that were regular.

7. I have 4.5 lakhs in fixed deposits and another 1.5 lakhs in highish interest accounts in the way of an emergency fund. I maintain at least 1 lakh rupees in my salary account for general expenses. I also have ~20 lakh rupees in credit limits across my credit cards for liquidity in a pinch.

8. I don't have a PF account because I don't believe in having my money held hostage by sarkaari naukri types.

9. I plan to invest 1 lakh rupees every month.

* NIFTYBEES - 30,000
* JUNIORBEES (NIFTY Next 50) - 18,000
* MID150BEES (MidCap 150) - 12,000
* VUAA (Ireland domiciled S&P500 accumulating ETF) - 20,000
* Nippon Small Cap Fund - 5,000
* Bandhan Small Cap Fund - 5,000
* GILT5YBEES (5 year government securities index ETF) - 10,000

* I'll just do a Zerodha stock SIP for everything except for VUAA, which I'll purchase through IBKR via an Indian Overseas Bank account.

* Any left over money I have at the end of the month, I intend to either chuck at MAFANG or collect into a separate pool to load larger sums into IBKR at once.

* I am looking for feedback on the distribution, the setup, anything else that I need to take into account, any blind spots, diversification suggestions etc. etc.

* Also looking for small cap mutual fund suggestions other than/in addition to Bandhan that I could invest into to minimise overlap.

* I'm particularly looking for feedback on the debt portion of my portfolio, since I don't have a PF account. Are there any actively managed instruments which would be a better fit for me?

* Also looking for advice on investing into NPS, I believe the tax benefit is only on the employer portion and not your own Tier 1 investments? Is there a solid reason to make that investment then?

Currently, I have ICICI Prudential Next 50 IETF and Nippon NIFTYBEES in my portolio in HDFC Securities. But I am not able to find these in Zerodha Coin. They are present in Zerodha Kite, without any labelling indicating if they are Direct Plans or Regular investment plans. 

  
I checked my NSDL repository and also cant find any labelling saying that my current plans are ""Direct"" there. 

  
So I am pretty confused, can you not buy ETFs on Zerodha Coin? Does that mean that the concept of Direct or Regular does not apply to them? In that case is this whole activity of moving my investments between platforms a useless one..? (as the original purpose is betrayed)

2025-05-10,Comparison of broad Indian index funds which track Nifty 500 or Nifty 750 (Total Market),"Quite a few new funds have been launched in this category, so thought I would do a comparison. Some comments on the table:

* Most of the funds were launched in 2024/2025, with the exception of HDFC, Groww (both 2023) and Motilal Oswal (2009) is the ""grandad"" of the bunch
* AUM - many of the new funds have only 20\~30 Cr in AUM; Two funds that stand out here are Motilal with 2100 Cr. and SBI with 800 Cr. Tier-2 seems to be Axis , HDFC and Groww all around 200\~300 Cr.
* Expense ratio - the best one is Axis at 0.10%, followed by Mirae at 0.14%; Tier-2 is Motilal and Angel One at 0.2%\~0.28%; Rest are 0.3%\~0.4%; For comparison , you can buy the cheapest Nifty 50 index funds at 0.05%\~0.10% expense ratio
* Tracking error - Several of these are too new (ICICI, Mirae, Bandhan, Angel One) to have reliable Tracking error data yet. But ones that have been around for some time have a tracking error of 0.1%\~0.2%; For comparison, the best Nifty 50 index funds have tracking error of 0.05% \~ 0.10%
* Performance of the benchmarks (500 or 750 indices) has been slightly better than Nifty 50 (+2\~3% annually) over the last five years, even though small/mid-caps have corrected in the last year
* My conclusion: A broader index (500 or 750) seems to be a better way to get exposure to Indian equities; My pick of the bunch (for now) would be Motilal Oswal, given their long operating record and AUM; However, this should be reviewed in 1\~2 years when we have enough time to gauge the other funds' performance and tracking errors

2025-04-29,"Identity Theft Alert: How a ₹3,000 Fraudulent Loan Appeared on My Credit Report","I recently discovered an unauthorized loan entry on my Experian credit report. A ₹3,000 loan under account number from Ram Fincorp (https://www.ramfincorp.com/) had been taken out in my name without my knowledge or consent.

Upon contacting the lender to dispute this fraudulent entry, they requested my KYC documents which struck me as odd, considering they should already possess this information if I were legitimately their customer.

My investigation revealed that the loan had been disbursed to an Airtel Payments Bank account linked to phone number 8145612358, a number I have never owned or used. Airtel confirmed that my personal numbers have never been associated with any of their payment bank accounts.

For 269 days, this account had been in default. The initial ₹3,000 had accumulated to ₹13,337 with penalties and interest. Throughout this period, Ram Fincorp never contacted me regarding missed payments.

After filing a complaint with the RBI, Ram Fincorp acknowledged the issue. Their proposed resolution was to temporarily ""suppress"" the loan from my CIBIL records for 30 days during their investigation, characterizing this as a ""goodwill gesture."" This is not a permanent solution; if their investigation is as flawed as their loan disbursement process, I may need to take further action to protect my credit history.

Several critical questions remain:

1. How did the lender approve a loan in my name without proper verification protocols?
2. Why was payment sent to a phone number/account with no connection to my identity?
3. What measures are being implemented to prevent such incidents in the future?

This case demonstrates a concerning vulnerability in the financial system. Fraudsters can apparently secure small loans using stolen identities with minimal verification, leaving the victims to deal with the consequences to their credit history.

I'm sharing this experience to alert others to this type of fraud. Be vigilant about regularly checking your credit reports for unauthorized entries, even small amounts that might seem insignificant but can cause disproportionate damage.

Has anyone encountered similar situations? What additional steps beyond the RBI complaint would you recommend? I'm particularly interested in hearing about effective resolutions that address the root causes rather than merely removing negative entries.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/1kajq0v/identity_theft_alert_how_a_3000_fraudulent_loan/,IndiaInvestments,"Identity Theft Alert: How a ₹3,000 Fraudulent Loan Appeared on My Credit Report.

2025-04-28,Can the nominee for insurances & investments be claimed into a Joint account?,"My mother unfortunately passed away a short while ago and I'm trying to sort out the family's finances. My father can't move around much and is largely restricted to the house and works via his laptop, so I need to do most of the formalities. 

My mother did not have a will, there are many insurances, investments, gratuity, PF, etc that we need to claim. My father is the nominee for most of them. Can all of them be claimed into a Joint account b/w my father and I? Or does it have to be an account solely owned by him? 
I need access to the money to settle some of the liabilities and I don't want to transfer large amounts b/w both of our single accounts, I would prefer if we could hold in a joint account and handle the money together. I want to use the same account for anything that I'm a nominee for and decide on how to use the money together. 

Please tell me if this makes sense or if any other approach is better. I don't have any large trust issues but after some financial decisions in the past by the family, I would feel better just having access/a view into the account.

2025-04-26,Gensol's founders stole money from PFC and IREDA. What are the chances they recover their money? A fun read,"*Original Source:* [*https://boringmoney.in/p/gensol-steals-public-lenders-lose*](https://boringmoney.in/p/gensol-steals-public-lenders-lose) *(my newsletter Boring Money - if you like what you read, do visit the original link to subscribe and receive future posts directly in your inbox)*

\--

The short story is that Gensol is a solar energy company which borrowed money from a couple of public sector lenders and did not pay them back. The lenders expected Gensol to use the borrowed money to buy electric cars for its business, but Gensol preferred shuffling the money around and buying expensive real estate and embarrassing looking chocolates \[1\] instead.

People first realised something was shady last month when Gensol’s credit rating agency, ICRA, [downgraded](https://www.icra.in/Rationale/ShowRationaleReport?Id=133471) it and said that the company lied about repaying its loans and even fudged some documents. Gensol being a listed company, SEBI was on this and last week [released an order](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/apr-2025/interim-order-in-the-matter-of-gensol-engineering-limited_93458.html) against Gensol and its founders. Some fine choice of words there:

>What has been witnessed in the present matter is a complete breakdown of internal controls and corporate governance norms in Gensol, a listed company. The promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a propriety firm. The Company’s funds were routed to related parties and used for unconnected expenses, as if the Company’s funds were promoters’ piggybank.

Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, the founders of Gensol, stole money from PFC and IREDA, two public sector NBFCs focused on lending to companies in the energy space. Can they expect to get their money back?

# Do loans or do shares, don’t do both

PFC and IREDA lent ₹664 crore ($77 million) to Gensol to buy electric cars. Gensol was supposed to chip in an additional ₹166 crore ($19 million) and buy the cars with the combined ₹830 crore.

Gensol *did* buy the cars, but it only spent some ₹568 crore ($66 million). It completely skipped putting up its own money and it also left out about ₹96 crore ($11 million) from the money PFC/IREDA lent it. That money, or at least part of that money, is what got spent on DLF’s luxury flat, golf gear, vacations, chocolates, and the rest of the good stuff.

Now this was a secured loan. Secured by electric cars, of course. PFC/IREDA can, theoretically, take over those cars and sell them off to get some of their money back. They’re [considering](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/pfc-ireda-mull-sale-of-gensol-evs-to-secure-loans/articleshow/120463025.cms?from=mdr) doing that—but it’s not going to be trivial!

The cars aren’t with Gensol to begin with. They’re leased to BluSmart, another company owned by Gensol’s founders. I mean, they might not even physically be with BluSmart at the moment, the company [shut operations](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/blusmart-begins-pullback-of-ride-hailing-operations/articleshow/120340973.cms?from=mdr) overnight. The cars will be with BluSmart’s drivers in different parts of the country, in different shapes and forms. The lenders will have to first get BluSmart to retrieve those cars, and then seize them from BluSmart itself. Yeah, it’s going to be a while.

Whenever PFC/IREDA manage to herd all the cars back, cars being a depreciating asset, they’re going to lose money on the sale. The cars were originally worth ₹568 crore, and they’ll be between 2–4 years old. Optimistically they’ll get back maybe 60–70% of that? Of course, they lent ₹664 crore in all, and they’ll have to spend on the entire recovery operations, valuations, auctions, etc. *and* let’s not even get into the lost interest income. They’ll be lucky to get back half of what they lent out.

Apart from the cars, IREDA has Gensol stock as collateral. From SEBI’s order:

>We have been informed by IREDA vide email dated April 11, 2025 that promoters have created pledges for 75.74 Lakh shares of Gensol. Further, the latest pledge invocation data available on the BSE website, indicates that more pledges have been invoked during this month. This would lead to the possible conclusion that promoter shareholding in Gensol would become even lower, may be negligible, if IREDA were to invoke the pledge created by Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi.

Gensol has about 3.8 crore shares in all. Twenty percent of those shares, owned by the Jaggis, were pledged as collateral to IREDA. But Gensol’s share price has been tanking for the last 2 months now, and it looks like the company’s going to be worth zero or close to zero, very soon.

I know I have the luxury of hindsight as I say this, but the choice of Gensol’s shares as collateral is a little unusual? When someone’s shares are pledged, it’s because they have borrowed money using their own shares as collateral. In this case, the loan IREDA made wasn’t to the Jaggis, it was to Gensol itself. And yet the Jaggis’ shares were pledged as collateral.

I get why IREDA would’ve liked to have some pledged shares. Listed shares are nice and convenient. You know what they’re worth, there’s no need to auction them, no need to go to court to seize them. If you’ve lent someone money against shares and they ditch paying you back, you can open your laptop, login to your brokerage account, find and click the “invoke pledge” button on their website, and the shares are yours. \[2\]

But IREDA lent to Gensol and then turned around and took Gensol’s shares as collateral! \[3\] If you’re a lender it would be nice to ensure that your collateral doesn’t get obliterated if your borrower decides to not repay. I am sympathetic. Gensol is supposed to be a solar energy company, not an electric car-leasing company. IREDA was lending to it for a side-biz, and it presumably did some calculations and figured that even if the electric car business flopped, the solar energy business would be enough to give the company’s shares its value. Apparently not!

# Regulatory affairs all right

Gensol bought its electric cars from a company called [Go Auto](http://goauto.in/), and it was this company that enabled the Jaggis’ fraud. Gensol would pay Go Auto for cars (apparently), but Go Auto would turn around and transfer this money back to a company either owned directly by the Jaggis or someone related to them.

There is a weird possibility for PFC/IREDA. Gensol, on the face of it, did buy cars worth ₹568 crore. But that’s what Gensol reported with Go Auto on the other side of the trade. I wouldn’t be surprised if this figure itself happens to be inflated and the lenders realise the real market price for the cars was even lower. \[4\]

One of the companies that Go Auto transferred the money that Gensol paid it to was called Wellray Solar Industries. From SEBI’s order:

>Subsequently, on the same day (February 01, 2023) Rs. 54.62 Crore was transferred to Go-Auto (Bank A/c No. 06792000003065 with HDFC Bank). Before this transaction, Go-Auto’s account had a balance of Rs. 4.86 Crore. On the very next day (February 02, 2023), Go-Auto transferred Rs. 40 Crore to the Bank Account of Wellray (A/c No. 058605002357 with ICICI Bank), which had a balance of Rs. 4.93 Lakh before the receipt

\[…\]

>Presently, almost the entire shareholding (99%) of Wellray is held by Lalit Solanki, who was employed as Regulatory Affairs Manager at the Gensol Group until December 2018, as per information available on LinkedIn.

The Jaggis trusted a former employee enough to transfer ₹40 crore ($4.6 million) to a shell company entirely in his name! Imagine if he had run off with it.

This former employee, Lalit Solanki, used to be a *regulatory affairs manager* at Gensol. Is it just me or is there something humorously ironic about using your *regulatory affairs* guy to defraud lenders?

**Footnotes**

\[1\] [Some](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/blusmart-anmol-singh-jaggi-lavish-spend-dlf-camellias-apartment-crore-dirhams-26-lakh-golf-gear-spa-session-more-details-11744780383051.html) news sources referred to these embarrassing chocolates as “spa sessions”.

2025-04-25,Advice on Mutual Fund Portfolio and Education Loan Repayment,"Hi everyone,

**TL;DR:**

32M with ₹1CR education loan at 10.8% (trying to reduce it). Salary ₹2.7–2.9L now, rising to ₹6L/month in 2 years.

Trying to figure out:

* How to build a solid MF portfolio (SIP categories + allocations)
* Whether to prepay the loan or invest aggressively and use compounding
* If I should switch my loan from MCLR to repo-linked
* How to plan for rising income while managing investing vs loan payoff

  
**THE LONG STORY WHICH SHOWS CONTEXT**

I’ve been deep-diving into personal finance and mutual fund investing lately and wanted to share my current situation to get your perspectives. My case is a bit specific due to the presence of a large education loan, and I’m hoping to hear from those who’ve navigated similar trade-offs between investing and debt repayment.

**About Me:**

* Age: 32
* Take-home salary: ₹2.7L–₹2.9L/month
* Fixed expenses: ₹40K
* Personal spends: ₹50K/month (shopping excluded)
* Education loan: ₹1 CR at 10.8%
* EMI: ₹1.25L/month (my dad helps by contributing ₹65K of that)

**Some More Context:**

I’ve recently gotten serious about wealth creation and have spent the last few weeks studying mutual funds. I’ve covered stuff like alpha, beta, standard deviation, Sharpe ratio, capture ratios, rolling returns, etc. (Shoutout to Zerodha Varsity,ChatGPT and Youtube.)

That said, I’m now stuck on what to actually do.

**Investments So Far:**

* **Vacation fund**: ₹40K/month goes toward an annual international trip. Right now this just sits in my savings account, which feels inefficient. Should I be parking this in an arbitrage fund or ultra-short-term debt instead?
* **Emergency fund:** ₹1.6L total (₹1L in Kotak Equity Arbitrage). Aditionally, also starting a SIP of ₹10K/month into an arbitrage fund. Does that make sense?

**The Real Dilemma: Portfolio Construction**

I want to build a solid mutual fund portfolio but I’m not sure how to split it.

* How much should go into large-cap, flexi-cap, multi-cap, mid-cap, etc.?
* What kind of SIP structure would be reasonable for someone like me?
* I know I’ve started investing relatively late, so part of me says “play it safe,” but another part of me thinks a moderate-risk strategy is okay too. Would love your take on this.

**Salary Will Increase Soon — How Should I Plan for It?**

* Next year my salary is expected to jump to around ₹3.5–₹3.8L/month
* The year after, likely around ₹6L/month

How should I factor this in when building my investment plan? Should I go light now and ramp up later, or front-load the SIPs and maintain them?

**Big Question: What to Do About the Loan?**

**1. MCLR vs Repo:**

I’ve pushed my bank to reduce the loan rate from 10.8% to 9%. I’m still negotiating for 8.5%.

It’s currently MCLR-based. Should I switch it to repo-linked? Or stay on MCLR given where interest rates are right now?

**2. Split Portfolio?**

I’m considering running two parallel portfolios:

* One for wealth creation
* One for prepaying a chunk of the loan in 5–6 years

Does this make sense? Keep in mind, I’m currently getting full 80E deduction on interest (paying \~₹10L interest per year).



**3. Prepay vs Invest?**

This is the biggest mental tug-of-war.

If I’m paying 9% interest but my investments can reasonably return \~12%, should I just let compounding do its thing and avoid prepaying?

Or is it still smarter to reduce the loan burden early?

Would really appreciate your insights. Especially if you’ve had to deal with loan vs investing trade-offs or planned portfolios with salary jumps in mind.

Thanks in advance!

I read that the medical inflation is more than normal inflation at 8-13 %. There are people who cannot get health insurance due to some rare diseases or bad credit score or not being an Indian citizen.

2025-04-15,"A macro view on US Dollar and EURO, GBP, INR | DXY nearing multiyear support trendline","Throughout the last month, USD weakened due to the tariff drama.

USD/INR pair held up due to RBI (the Indian central bank) stepping in to buy USD but otherwise USD weakened against most currencies especially against EURO and GBP.

  
Now DXY is nearing a multi-year support and I believe is primed for an UPSIDE RALLY soon although it may/may not touch the support before starting the rally which makes it for a risky entry now or maybe missing the trade altogether if it shoots up. Staggered entry would make the most sense.

[DXY nearing multi year support trendline](https://preview.redd.it/j8rjmi1nh1ve1.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=3248748ca4f9785a09c3a88e4fa131452e682874)

The reason USD weakened over the last month could be attributed to a combination of below causes:

\- Trump tariffs created uncertainty in markets and led to eroding trust--> Both the equity and bond markets fell hard signalling the flight of capital away from the US economy and potentially to other currencies particularly EURO etc--> Dumping of USD and US treasury bonds by central banks (allegedly by China) and/or big hedge funds and safe haven flow to non USD instruments like eurobonds (for ex: Swiss bond yields dropped significantly over last month)

https://preview.redd.it/y9tqe3eph1ve1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=540b6b9f4c043e97d1d8d5f94da898182de42eb9

\- Sudden jump in US bond yields may have led to unwinding of the basis trade; also unwinding of yen (JPY) carry trade might also have led to outflow of capital from us markets.

WHAT NEXT?

I believe as the dust settles, most countries which aren't the enemy of the USA would enter trade agreements and/or resort to devalue their currencies to favor exports while the tariff war with China goes on.

I am sceptical of the view that ""US led world order would collapse, and USD will sharply lose it's value since it would no longer be the world reserve currency"".

As things stand, I think a good upside rally in USD (and the DXY) is on the cards.

BULLISH ON USD AND DXY. Particularly on USD/INR pair since RBI has a history of maintaining weaker INR even in times where dollar weakens. So, USD strengthening along with tariffs going on in the background should lead to a good fall in INR.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/1jzyug2/a_macro_view_on_us_dollar_and_euro_gbp_inr_dxy/,IndiaInvestments,"A macro view on US Dollar and EURO, GBP, INR | DXY nearing multiyear support trendline.

One of the things you would do as a bank is look for places to borrow money at a low interest rate so that you can lend it out at a higher interest rate and pocket the difference. Interest rates in India are higher than interest rates in many other countries, so here’s an obvious trade:

1. Borrow $10 million from the US (or wherever) for 5 years at, say, 5% interest.
2. Convert the money to ₹86 crore and lend it out at 10% interest.

Of course it’s not *that* simple. Your interest income is in rupees, but your principal and the interest you pay out are in dollars. If the dollar goes up against the rupee, it’s going to be a problem.

So you hedge against the dollar going up! The typical way to do this is by entering a currency swap. Here’s how that would work:

1. You have dollars and need rupees. You find someone who has rupees and needs dollars.
2. Give them your $10 million. They give you the equivalent ₹86 crore. All yours to lend out at 10%.
3. Every year you pay each other a pre-decided interest amount. You have ₹86 crore, so maybe you pay 8% interest. The other guy has $10 million, so maybe he pays you 5%. \[1\]
4. You take that 5% on $10 million every year and give it to your lender in the US.
5. At the end of the 5 years, you exchange your principal amounts. You get back your $10 million and return it to your lender in the US.

You no longer care about the exchange rate going up, down, or in circles. The currency swap ensures that—the interest you get, the interest you pay, and the principal you return are all pre-decided. At the end of the day, you have a predictable profit.

How does this swap show up in your financials? You may have borrowed the dollars at 5%, but you’re paying 8% interest on the equivalent rupee amount. Intuitively, you might put that 8% in your expenses tab. The 10% you’re earning as interest from your borrowers goes into your income. The 2% difference is your profit. This is similar to what you would do had you borrowed rupees directly. \[2\]

But you haven’t borrowed rupees directly! You’ve done a currency swap! It’s a bit like holding a magic rock. As long as you hold the rock, the exchange rates can’t touch you. If you hold it for the full 5 years, you get exactly the rate you started with. But if you drop it early, the exchange rate hits you hard in the face. To get your original $10 million back you’ll have to close your position and pay for it at the ongoing exchange rate.

To account for this risk of you trying to get out of your contract, there’s the mark-to-market accounting. If the dollar goes up against the rupee, you immediately go to your financials and record that as a loss. You know, just *in case* you decide to no longer hold the magic rock. If you hold the swap for the full 5 years, great, you can just go and cancel out your losses from earlier. \[3\] In this case both the mark-to-market accounting (the second type) and the swap cost accounting (the first type) converge.

After all that context, here’s the story: Two weeks ago, IndusInd Bank disclosed that it had bought some foreign exchange derivatives that were [not accounted for properly](https://www.business-standard.com/markets/news/indusind-bank-shares-fall-on-derivative-discrepancy-crisis-explained-here-125031200346_1.html). The problem, the company said, was that it had used swap cost accounting when it was supposed to use mark-to-market accounting. This caused the bank to add ₹1,577 crore to its expenses overnight because of which its stock price fell by more than 25%.

# Internal, external and everything in between

Right after this announcement, a bunch of IndusInd executives [spoke to analysts](https://www.indusind.com/content/dam/indusind-corporate/investors/QuarterFinancialResults/FY2024-2025/Quarter4/Analyst-Call-Transcript_10thMarch2025.pdf). Here’s what one of the executives said:

>

IndusInd had two teams doing trades. One was responsible for hedging stuff (with an incredibly boring name, “Balance Sheet Management Desk”, but let’s call it BSMD which feels like an apt typo). The other was the trading desk.

If the company borrowed dollars or yen or whatever, the BSMD would do a currency swap with the company’s own trading desk. Later, the trading desk would itself get into another currency swap with someone else from outside and hedge its own exposure. (The trading desk took the parcel from the hedging team and passed it along.)

This sort of makes sense? If you’ve borrowed foreign currency you have to hedge as quickly as possible. And currency swaps aren’t a particularly liquid market. You need to find someone who is okay swapping their rupees for your currency, is okay with the tenure of the swap, and you also need to find enough of these folks to cover the presumably large amount you’ve borrowed as a bank. Instead of waiting to find the right counterparty, you could just pass on the swap to your *real* trading desk who trade things all day for a living.

All good up till now. Here’s what wasn’t good:

>So the external trade was mark-to-market, while the internal trade was on swap cost accounting or swap valuation. These 2 legs would vary during the period of contract, but converge on maturity.

The external trade was marked to market. If the rupee went up or down, the swap with the external party could result in a profit or a loss that would reflect in the company’s books. But the internal trade was recorded using swap cost accounting where the exchange rate didn’t matter. Think about how this would play out:

1. Let’s assume the rupee goes up against the foreign currency. The trading desk records a profit on its external trade.
2. But the trading desk technically makes a loss on its internal trade. It’s holding the exact opposite contract with the boring balance sheet management team.
3. The internal trade is not marked to market! The trading desk doesn’t record a loss there. (The BSMD, of course, makes no profit or loss adjustment at all.)

If IndusInd held both the internal and external contracts until maturity, none of this would eventually matter. I do empathise a little bit with the bank picking swap cost accounting instead of mark-to-market for the convenience of it, but it’s so so weird for one side of the trade to show up with a profit without an equivalent loss on the other side to cancel it out. The company mentioned borrowing in yen and the rupee has [strengthened against the yen](https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=INR&to=JPY&view=5Y) in the last 5 years so I’m guessing this is where the profit overstatement happened.

This stuff makes IndusInd’s financials look better. Would IndusInd have let this go on for so long had the mismatch made its financials look *worse*?

# Sudden death

In September 2023, RBI released a [bunch of new directions](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12534#:~:text=14.%20FVTPL,Schedule%208%3A%E2%80%99Investments%E2%80%99.) defining exactly how banks’ investments must be valued. One of the directions was that derivatives, including currency swaps, were to be marked to market. IndusInd said that this new rule was the trigger for them to go back to the drawing board and re-evaluate how they were accounting for their derivatives. That’s when they discovered the inconsistency between their internal and external trades.

They had to plug this inconsistency once they discovered it, the result of which was that the bank was hit with a sudden ₹1,577 crore loss. Is this loss real or just an accounting quirk? It sounds like an accounting quirk to me at the moment, but I wouldn’t be too sure.

There are still a bunch of unknowns. Later today PwC is [supposed to be submitting](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/external-auditor-pwc-may-submit-report-on-indusind-banks-accounting-discrepancies-on-friday/articleshow/119464538.cms?from=mdr) an audit report of this entire thing. Let’s see what gold that brings us.



**Footnotes**

\[1\] I’m picking some convenient figures here but the interest percentages depend on each country’s interest rates, the expected currency movements, etc.

\[2\] If you’re using swap cost accounting you need to make some additional accounting adjustments. For example, if the rupee goes down, you record a loss, but you also get to offset it with a profit on the swap itself.

\[3\] By cancel out I mean if you added a loss earlier, you can negate it by adding a profit now.

In the financial world, if you’re a company giving money to another company, it’s likely for one of three reasons:

1. You’re lending it money and expect some fixed interest in return. The riskier the company you’re lending to, the more interest you expect.
2. You’re investing in the company. If things work out, the value of your stake in the company goes up, and you make money. If not, you lose money, but that’s okay. That’s the game you’re playing.
3. You’re investing, but the investment is strategic. You both bring something to the table, fill in each other’s gaps. Eventually, you’ll run a great business together and own a share of the profit.

Nice, clear differences. Right?

In 2018, the State Bank of India gave some money to Reliance Industries. The idea was that they would start a payments bank together called [Jio Payments Bank](https://www.jiobank.in/). Reliance owned 70% of the company and SBI the remaining 30%.

On the face of it this was a strategic investment for SBI. But even at that time, this was a little unusual for a few reasons:

1. Payments banks are a weird type of bank. They can take money from people as deposits, but can’t lend that money out as loans. Making money is tough.
2. SBI is a bank! It could do everything Jio Payments Bank could ever do, and much much more.
3. Jio Payments Bank sounds like *Reliance*, not like SBI.

Maybe SBI saw great business potential in Jio Payments and was happy to be a part of it. But then [this happened](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/jio-financial-to-acquire-sbi-stake-in-jio-payments-bank-for-rs-104-5-crore-125030400697_1.html) last week:

>The State Bank of India (SBI) has decided to divest its entire 17.8 per cent stake in Jio Payments Bank Limited, a joint venture between the state-owned bank and Jio Financial Services (JFS).

>JFS will acquire the SBI’s stake for ₹104.5 crore, after which Jio Payments Bank will become its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Reliance Group firm said on Tuesday.

Okay maybe this wasn’t a strategic investment after all but was financial? After eight years, SBI sold its entire stake back to Reliance itself for ₹104.5 crore ($12m).

Intuitively we know that it wasn’t the most successful investment. Jio Payments Bank is still a no-name in the payments industry. And it’s been losing money like a tech startup (with a loss of ₹50 crore last financial year) but with a revenue (₹30 crore last year) that doesn’t show for it.

# Investments in Jio Payments Bank

|FY|Reliance Investment (₹ Cr)|SBI Investment (₹ Cr)|SBI’s Share (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Total|444|79|—|
|FY 25|96\*|0|18|
|FY 24|4|0|23|
|FY 23|80|0|23|
|FY 22|22|9|30|
|FY 21|0|0|30|
|FY 20|0|0|30|
|FY 19|162|70|30|

But just how bad a financial investment was this for SBI? In FY 2019, SBI invested ₹70 crore ($8m). In FY 2022, it invested another ₹9 crore ($1m). So that’s a total of ₹79 crore. Then in FY 2025, it’s selling its stake for ₹104.54 crore. That’s an annual return rate of 4.57%. \[1\]

SBI would’ve made more money had it invested in its own fixed deposits.

# Not a lot of interest

So, SBI gave Reliance some money. Then Reliance gave it back with a 4.57% annualised return.

This sounds a bit like… a loan? Lending to start a startup is a no go, too risky for any bank’s underwriting team. But an investment is fine! So maybe it made sense to just call it an investment instead?

The pieces of the puzzle fall into place if you treat SBI’s investment as a low-interest loan. But hey, of course, it was just a strategic investment in a joint venture with Reliance that happened to not work out.

Answers are always subjective to your personal needs, but use those threads a starting point for you to look at what other Redditors have to say about a company, product, fund, or service.

You can then ask a more specific question about what product or service to buy, once you are able to frame your personal situation.

**NOTE** If your question is _I got 10k INR, what do I do to get most returns out of it?_, or anything similar; there is no single answer to this question. But we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to provide some sort of answer:

- How old are you?
- Are you employed/making income?
- How much? What are your objectives with this money?
- Do you have any loan, or big expense coming up?
- What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know it's 100% safe?)
- What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Have you invested in equity before?)
- Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Partner pushing you to spend more?
- What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
- Any big debts?
- Any other relevant financial information about you, that will be useful to give you an informed response.

2025-02-23,"After a year-and-half of conflict, the Burmans finally own Religare. Rashmi Saluja, the former chairperson, tried everything but failed to stall it","*Original Source:* [*https://boringmoney.in/p/burman-open-offer-religare-promoter*](https://boringmoney.in/p/burman-open-offer-religare-promoter?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=religare+burman+saluja) *(my newsletter Boring Money, if you like what you read, please subscribe to receive future posts directly in your inbox)*

There’s a bit of a weird understanding around company ownership in India. If you’re out in the market looking to take control of a listed company, sure, you should lap up as many of the company’s shares as you can. Intuitively, you would need to buy at least 51% of the company’s stock to get control. But not in India! Even if you own less than that, if the company marks you as a “promoter”, you end up effectively owning \[1\] the company.

There’s quite a bit of confusion and conflict around this understanding. Sometimes the founder and CEO of a company owning 10% doesn’t want to be called the promoter, but is [forced to](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/vijay-shekhar-sharma-paytm-directors-face-sebi-show-cause-notices-over-ipo-breaches-12806852.html). Other times an investor who owns 17% [cannot remove](https://www.medianama.com/2021/10/223-explained-zee-invesco-summary/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) a promoter holding less than 4%.

Being a promoter is a state of being. You don’t need a large stake. If you’re calling the shots day-to-day, you’re a promoter. It works the other way too. If you don’t control a company just yet, but want to, you better get yourself put down as a promoter. It’s like drawing a superpower from within the soul of the company that gives you the permission and access to decide how it works.

This week, the Burman family, who are the promoters of the Ayurvedic brand Dabur, also [became the promoters](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/burman-family-acquires-control-become-promoters-of-religare-enterprises-125022001226_1.html) of Religare Enterprises, a financial services conglomerate. They were in the market to own about 51% of Religare, but their offer to buy the public’s shares failed miserably. No matter! They still own 25% of its shares, but more importantly, after a long-drawn conflict, they passed the company’s vibe check and managed to call themselves its promoters.

# An offer that you can refuse

Before this week, Religare did not have a promoter. They did, [once upon a time](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/from-singh-brothers-to-burman-brothers-religares-promoter-blues-continue/articleshow/105266662.cms?from=mdr), but for the last seven years they didn’t. This isn’t a problem. There are large companies like ITC and HDFC Bank without a promoter, and all it means is that there is no one shareholder calling the shots on how the company operates. The shareholders with varying levels of ownership have some representation on the board, which then assigns the CEO, and the CEO reports to the board just as a regular employee would. (And when the CEO leaves, their son or nephew doesn’t take over.)

In September 2023, the Burmans owned \~21% of Religare, which they bought over a few years from the open market. They intended to buy 4% more and exceed 25% in total ownership. There’s a SEBI mandate around such high ownership. If you happen to own 25% of a company’s shares, you have to then offer to buy at least 26% of its remaining shares as well. The idea is that this gives *you* the opportunity to own a controlling stake in the company, and also gives people who may not like you the opportunity to sell their stock to you and get out.

If you’re a serious buyer, your offer to the public had better be more than the stock’s market price. We’re talking about a publicly listed company here—people can sell their shares and move on anyway. The only reason they’d sell to you is if you offered them a better-than-market price for their shares.

When the Burman family first announced their intention to run an offer, Religare’s stock price was around ₹270. The Burmans offered ₹235, a good 13% lower.

The Burmans announced the offer one-and-a-half years back, but it actually happened just last week. And [it failed](https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/EFAC8052-C655-4C3B-BC69-8B8C5D55B04A-134530.pdf)! They were out to buy ₹2,116 crore of Religare stock. Shareholders agreed to sell only 0.25% of that, about ₹5.4 crore.

That’s what makes the Burman family’s successful takeover a little weird. They made a shitty offer, it didn’t go through, and yet they control Religare? Tell me if being a promoter isn’t a state of being.

# She does not give up

There are two things I want to mention about Rashmi Saluja, one of them totally irrelevant to this story.

1. Until last week, she was the executive chairperson of Religare.
2. She was [deboarded](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/air-india-kicks-out-troublesome-head-of-a-top-financial-company-as-she-was-rude/articleshow/108285668.cms?from=mdr) from an Air India flight for being rude to the crew.

Saluja had been the chairperson since [December 2019](https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/a7a2e5c3-6e03-4b41-998b-bd6ad741896a.pdf) (the deboarding happened last year) at a time when Religare was almost a dead company because its founders [stole](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-court-frames-criminal-conspiracy-charges-former-religare-enterprises-promoters-loss-firm-9784145/) from the company. I don’t know how Religare turned around, but it did. Saluja had been the chairperson all this while so looks like she did a [good job](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/rashmi-saluja-steered-religare-2-0-through-upheaval-changed-firms-fortunes/articleshow/93994326.cms?from=mdr) with it.

>\[[Image Link](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F447409d6-68c7-4b44-b7f1-7b461d0a52b8_653x408.png)\]

Saluja did not want the Burmans to take over Religare. Makes sense to me. If you’re a corporate turnaround artist at a financial services company, you wouldn’t want the company to be taken over by a billionaire family selling [adulterated honey](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/health/honey-fraud-our-response-to-statements-from-dabur-patanjali-74512). But just how far do you go to keep your job?

Pretty far. Here’s a bit from [earlier this month](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-rashmi-saluja-moves-court-again-religare-board-fights-back-3746738/) from the Financial Express:

>The battle for control of Religare Enterprises (REL) has started looking like a never-ending soap opera. On Tuesday, Rashmi Saluja, the ousted executive chairperson of REL, made the first move by filing a fresh writ petition in the Delhi High Court, seeking to quash the open offer by the Burman family-led entities. This marks the seventh legal attempt by her to stall the takeover process. The court is expected to hear her petition on Wednesday (today).

Seventh legal attempt! Saluja does not give up. \[2\]

# Fit and proper!

Religare is a holding company for a brokerage, an insurance company, and an NBFC, among other smaller businesses. For the Burman family to become the promoter, they had to get the approval of the regulator for each line of business. That’s SEBI for being a broker, IRDAI for insurance, and RBI for the NBFC.

It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me, but someone looking to buy a company like Religare, cannot apply directly to the regulators for approval. Instead, the company itself has to go to its regulators and say “hey this guy’s looking to buy me, are you okay if we let him run an offer for our shareholders to consider?”. The company does have some discretion here. If a potential acquirer isn’t credible, it need not go to the regulators and waste their time. But the Burmans already owned 21% of Religare, obviously had the means to buy more, so Religare didn’t really have any room for discretion.

And yet, Religare’s board, led by Saluja, decided that it did not want to take the Burmans’ offer to the regulators for approval. Apparently the Burmans did not meet the criteria that owners and executives for financial companies must be “fit and proper”.

Fit and proper? That sounds familiar. [We spoke about](https://boringmoney.in/p/embassy-reit-looks-at-a-fraud#:~:text=SEBI%20wanted%20the%20REIT%E2%80%99s%20CEO%20to%20be%20a%20%E2%80%9Cfit%20and%20proper%20person%E2%80%9D%20which%20is%20just%20a%20bunch%20of%20floor%20criteria%20for%20stuff%20like%20not%20having%20defrauded%20anyone%20or%20being%20a%20criminal.%20Embassy%20REIT%E2%80%99s%20argument%20was%20that%20its%20CEO%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20need%20to%20be%20a%20%E2%80%9Cfit%20and%20proper%20person%E2%80%9D%3F!) these criteria last year when a company argued that their CEO need not be fit and proper. Here Religare is arguing that the potential buyer absolutely must be fit and proper, and that it was deciding that they were not. Surely the Burmans must be in some financial soup? No?

From[ From a Mint report](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/bid-to-block-religare-acquisition-burman-family-slams-false-fir-linking-dabur-group-to-mahadev-betting-app-case-11699955913805.html):

>Members of the Dabur group have issued a rebuttal after reports linked its chairman and director to the Mahadev betting app case. The Mumbai Police has reportedly booked 32 people – including Mohit Burman and Gaurav Burman – under various sections of fraud and gambling. A spokesperson for the Burman family however dubbed it a ‘baseless’ accusation that happened to coincide with their bid to acquire Religare Enterprises.

>“We have not received any formal communication on any such FIR. However, we have sighted the FIR which is being circulated to media houses. The FIR is patently false and baseless. Nothing could be further from the truth than as wrongly stated in the FIR,” the spokesperson said.

The Burmans announced that it was going to do an open offer and in a few weeks there were reports that they had an FIR registered against them in an unrelated betting scam. \[3\] Religare used these reports to decide that the Burmans weren’t fit and proper, and wouldn’t even apply for approval to the regulators for good measure.

The Burmans then went to SEBI about this, who eventually forced Religare to actually apply for approval. [This was in June 2024](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/jun-2024/interim-order-cum-show-cause-notice-in-the-matter-of-religare-enterprises-limited_84286.html), a good nine months after the Burman family’s initial offer announcement. \[4\]

# Stall, stall, stall

Every year, usually sometime between July and September, every listed company in India holds their annual general meeting. This meeting is when companies are able to get all their important shareholders in one room and have them vote on things that need their approval to go through. Shareholders can also ask the board and executives questions (or share their unsolicited opinions) about the company.

Religare’s annual meeting was scheduled for sometime in September 2024, but the board delayed it to December. From [Mint](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/religare-enterprises-agm-delay-shareholders-rashmi-saluja-investors-burman-family-dabur-11724591594022.html):

>Three institutional shareholders said they were unhappy with the decision to postpone the AGM, especially since the company has given no explanation. The delay becomes crucial as chairperson Rashmi Saluja was up for reappointment at this AGM, initially scheduled for September.

>\[…\]

>Saluja is the only non-independent director on the Religare board and, therefore, comes up for retirement at each AGM. The vote to reappoint her will now take place in December after the company secured approval to defer the AGM by three months.

Saluja needed to win the shareholder vote to be reappointed as the chairperson of Religare. This vote is usually a formality, shareholders like to go for whoever’s being presented. Saluja probably didn’t want to risk it, so the meeting was pushed.

Then in December, some random guy filed a public interest litigation (?) in the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Jabalpur—a city that Religare has absolutely nothing to do with—and the court [asked to](https://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/madhya-pradesh-hc-stays-religare-enterprises-agm-in-response-to-pil/119722) wait on the meeting scheduled for 31 December (which by itself is a weird day to hold a meeting). In January, the court [finally allowed](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/madhya-pradesh-high-court-dismisses-pil-religare-agm-rashmi-saluja-125010900673_1.html) the meeting to proceed because it figured that the litigation was BS.

The meeting was then scheduled again for February, and this was challenged in court again! This time by Saluja herself in the Delhi High Court. The court [refused](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/delhi-hc-rejects-rashmi-saluja-s-plea-to-halt-religare-enterprises-agm-125020601716_1.html) to halt the meeting.

On 7 February, the meeting finally took place and [here’s what happened](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-suspense-at-agm-over-reappointment-of-saluja-3741671/):

>The annual general meeting (AGM) of Religare Enterprises on Friday took an interesting turn after chairperson Rashmi Saluja stopped the discussion on her reappointment (agenda 2), stating that she was not liable to retire by rotation, said sources.

>“So, we can ignore resolution number 2,” she said. When an independent director present at the meeting contested her decision, she dismissed the intervention, saying that his remarks should be taken on record.

Saluja still doesn’t give up! In the meeting, she told everyone that she wasn’t due to retire, and so there was no need for everyone to vote on her reappointment. How thoughtful of her to save everyone’s time.

Of course, that wasn’t the end of it. In the physical meeting, she managed to stop people from voting against her by making sure the vote itself didn’t happen. But voting was held online for shareholders who weren’t at the meeting and two days later [97%](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-over-97-religare-shareholders-reject-salujas-reappointment-3744393/) of Religare’s shareholders had voted against her reappointment. She was *finally* removed from her position as executive chairperson.

# It’s a state of being

Back to the Burmans. They wanted to become the promoters of Religare and decide how it should operate. Initially, Religare’s board of directors were against this and resisted to the extent that they could. Later it was just Saluja who remained obstinate to the extent of not even letting the Burmans’ offer reach the shareholders.

Becoming the promoter isn’t just about owning a large stake. Sure, yes, more shares don’t hurt. And beyond 51% there’s not a lot anyone else can do. But with Saluja no longer a board member, there was no one to stop the Burman family from becoming a promoter. So they became the promoter! Like I said, being a promoter is a state of being.

If Saluja hadn’t been booted out, whoever knows what would’ve happened? With the Burmans’ offer practically rejected by shareholders, there is no way she would’ve let Religare name them as the promoters. Eventually, sure, the Burmans would have succeeded. But that would cost time, legal fees, and maybe a lot more money for yet another long-drawn offer.

# Stay out of jail card

Why was Saluja hell bent on halting the Burmans’ offer? Maybe because she paid herself a lot! She held too much sway within the company and figured out a way to earn many multiples more than other executives at the same level. From [the Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/religare-finvest-issued-esops-to-rashmi-saluja-a-day-after-burmans-open-offer/articleshow/106497688.cms?from=mdr):

>\[…\] Rashmi Saluja, executive chairperson of the company, acquired around 8% stake in its wholly-owned shadow bank Religare Finvest Limited (RFL), through an Employees Stock Option Plan (Esop) award, documents reviewed by ET reveal.

>The award in the unlisted subsidiary ascribed its value in a band of Rs150-260 crore. Previously, proxy advisory firm InGovern had estimated the Esops awarded to Saluja in Religare Enterprises as well as its health insurance subsidiary Care Health Insurance to be worth Rs480 crore. Together with the thus far undeclared award of stock options in Religare Finvest, the total compensation earned by Saluja via Esops could be between Rs630 and Rs740 crore. This is in addition to the annual salary and places Saluja among the highest paid executives in Indian corporate history.

Highest paid executive in *Indian corporate history*! \[5\] Most of Saluja’s compensation came from the employee stock options pool of Religare’s subsidiaries, worth anywhere between ₹630 crore to ₹740 crore ($73m to $86m). Her stake was so high that it would represent 8% of Religare’s NBFC! The stock option pool is usually between 5–10%, meant to serve as an incentive for *all* employees to work to get the stock price up and stick around for longer. Saluja hogged the entire thing.

Okay, fighting to stay around as the highest paid executive in Indian corporate history would be alluring. But come on, the annual general meeting was seven days away, and she sued the company she was the chairperson at! And asked shareholders to casually ignore something they were to vote on! That’s extreme.

The Burman family have been [demanding](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/burman-family-demands-sebi-investigation-in-allotment-of-8-esops-shares-to-rfl-chairman-rashmi-saluja-11704286617650.html) an investigation into Saluja’s compensation. If the numbers are true, and they seem to be, Saluja has almost certainly been defrauding the company and its investors. With the Burmans running the company, I wouldn’t be surprised if any documentation around her compensation reached the investigator as a neatly formatted PDF of evidence. That makes her extreme behaviour make a [little bit more](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/ed-summons-religare-chairperson-rashmi-saluja-for-questioning/articleshow/116183872.cms?from=mdr) sense.

**Footnotes**

\[1\] I use “ownership” for promoters liberally, even though they don’t technically own the company. In everyday conversation I think the distinction doesn’t matter.

\[2\] This better be the name of any biography that happens to be written about Saluja.

\[4\] Religare then challenged SEBI’s ruling in the SAT, which [asked it to comply](https://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/sat-to-religare-comply-with-sebi-order-apply-for-open-offer-by-july-22/117512). So that was another month wasted.

\[5\] I like how the Economic Times emphasises this, but this may or may not be true! I doubt Saluja would keep getting those stock options every year for life. So not entirely accurate to count it as part of her regular compensation.

There’s a bit of a weird understanding around company ownership in India. If you’re out in the market looking to take control of a listed company, sure, you should lap up as many of the company’s shares as you can. Intuitively, you would need to buy at least 51% of the company’s stock to get control. But not in India! Even if you own less than that, if the company marks you as a “promoter”, you end up effectively owning \[1\] the company.

This statement might be true for Natco Pharma. Pharma companies in India are rated at PE ratios ranging from 20-50 while Natco which had been doing great since last many quarters was trading at a PE of 11-12.

Many people were compelled to buy the stock just because they couldn't digest a **company producing 40% sales growth YOY for 2 consecutive years trading at lower than the sectoral average/median P/E ratio.** And yet immediately after the Q3 earnings call, the stock saw another dip and is now trading at 7.5 P/E!

The reason being the 35% dip in revenue as management revealed that they didn't sell the drug Revlimid (which was giving >50% of their topline) in Q3 at all as they had exhausted their allocated sales quota inn US markets as per the agreement in Q2 itself.

But this wasn't revealed to investors in Q2 concall so they kept expecting another quarter with 20% YoY increment, but the reverse happened🤷🏻‍♂️

Now what are your views regarding the company after the recent fall/rerating? The current PE is 7.5 but since the company won't sell any Revlimid in FY27 due to patent expiry in Jan 2026 the future earnings prospects of the company are grim and hence the forward-looking P/E taking into account loss of sales due to Revlimid patent expiry would be many times higher than current PE ratio! Although if they find a new complex generic drug to market in US then it might skyrocket the stock once again!

2025-02-15,"The real estate market experts here, is there a housing bubble coming up in India?","

Is India Headed Toward a Housing Bubble?

I have a solid understanding of finance and economics, but I lack practical insights into the real estate market. Given the recent trends, I wanted to reach out to experts and experienced individuals for their perspectives.

There are several factors that raise concerns about a possible housing bubble in India:

1. Sky-High Valuations—Even in Tier 2 Cities

It’s well understood that Mumbai real estate is expensive due to high demand and limited land. A ₹2.5 crore 2BHK in Mumbai might not be overvalued, given the constraints. However, what’s concerning is that similar pricing trends are emerging in Tier 2 cities.

For example, newly launched projects in multiple Tier 2 cities are offering 2200 sq. ft. 3BHK apartments for ₹2 crore or more. This raises questions:
	•	Do these cities have sufficient demand to justify such high valuations?
	•	Are salaries and purchasing power in these regions keeping pace with price growth?
If the answer is no, then we might be looking at overinflated property values that are unsustainable in the long run.

2. Oversupply—More Flats Than Buyers?

In cities like Bangalore, while population growth is evident, the rate of new housing projects far exceeds the rate of population influx. Developers are launching new projects aggressively, but the number of people who can actually afford these homes isn’t rising at the same pace.

A key indicator of this is the way real estate firms are operating. In developed markets, builders sell apartments closer to completion because property values appreciate as the surrounding infrastructure develops. However, in Bangalore, developers push sales as soon as they acquire land. This suggests they may be anticipating a future oversupply, leading them to offload inventory before prices stagnate or decline.

3. Urban Pollution—A Long-Term Demand Constraint

India is one of the most densely populated countries, and with that comes extreme pollution—whether from vehicles or relentless construction. Major cities are already seeing worsening air quality, traffic congestion, and deteriorating living conditions.

Delhi is a prime example: no matter how much policy intervention occurs, pollution remains a severe, seemingly irreversible issue. Over time, this could drive demand away from city centers toward the outskirts or even smaller cities. If this shift occurs at scale, demand for housing in urban centers may decline, exacerbating any potential real estate downturn.

4. Slowing Population Growth—A Structural Demand Issue

India’s population growth is slowing significantly and is projected to decline in the coming decades. Historically, real estate demand has been underpinned by a growing population. However, if the total number of homebuyers starts decreasing over time, the demand-supply balance could tilt even further in favor of an oversupply, putting downward pressure on prices.

TLDR


While real estate markets often defy short-term expectations, the combination of high valuations, rapid supply growth, worsening urban conditions, and demographic shifts suggests that parts of India’s housing market could be heading toward a correction. The question is not just whether a bubble exists, but whether demand will sustain these prices in the long run.

Would love to hear insights from real estate professionals—do you see similar trends, or are there factors that could keep the market strong?",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/1ipv6vq/the_real_estate_market_experts_here_is_there_a/,IndiaInvestments,"The real estate market experts here, is there a housing bubble coming up in India?.

Generally speaking, there is no best stock, or fund, or bank, or brokerage, or investment platform.

Answers are always subjective to your personal needs, but use those threads a starting point for you to look at what other Redditors have to say about a company, product, fund, or service.

You can then ask a more specific question about what product or service to buy, once you are able to frame your personal situation.

**NOTE** If your question is _I got 10k INR, what do I do to get most returns out of it?_, or anything similar; there is no single answer to this question. But we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to provide some sort of answer:

- How old are you?
- Are you employed/making income?
- How much? What are your objectives with this money?
- Do you have any loan, or big expense coming up?
- What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know it's 100% safe?)
- What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Have you invested in equity before?)
- Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Partner pushing you to spend more?
- What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
- Any big debts?
- Any other relevant financial information about you, that will be useful to give you an informed response.

Beware that these answers are just opinions of fellow Redditors and should only be used as a starting point for your research. This is **NOT** financial advice, in legal sense of the term.

You should strongly consider consulting a registered fee-only financial advisor before making any financial decisions. Ideally, such advisors should be registered with SEBI, and have a registration number.

Bank couldn't get in touch with me on time but I had a deeper look into my account details and noticed that I had a lien of -165. I don't have any loans or a credit card.

Apparently this lien was because of failed recurring payments of subscription as per some bank's response to a support request online. Since I'm a student I don't readily have money in the account most of the time.

If you’re a large fund managing billions of dollars and looking to buy a stock, you would typically call one of two people:

* Your favourite stockbroker.
* Your favourite investment banker.

Both of these are perfectly reasonable choices depending on the situation. If you’re buying a liquid stock with a lot of sellers in the market, you can go directly to your stockbroker and tell them which stock at what price and you’ll have it. If the stock is a little less liquid you might have to go to your investment banker first and get them to incentivise other investors to sell.

What if you mixed things up? If you went to your broker to buy a stock that was less liquid and to your investment banker for a stock that was more liquid? \[1\] That would not make sense. If you placed a large order for a stock without enough sellers, the price of the stock would shoot up. You might not get the stock at the price that you want. And if the stock happens to be liquid, why would you want to pay a middleman fee to an investment banker in the first place? \[2\]

[Here’s a SEBI order](https://www.sebi.gov.in/sebi_data/attachdocs/dec-2024/Front_Running_Order_Big_Client.pdf) from earlier in the month about how Capital Group, a large American $2.7 trillion fund manager, was defrauded. The order doesn’t actually name Capital Group—it’s supposed to be the victim, after all—but the entire reason Capital could be defrauded was that the company, instead of calling up its stockbroker, called up its investment banker. Wait, scratch that. Capital didn’t even call up an actual investment banker, it called up some random guy named Rohit Salgaocar with a no-name financial services firm in Singapore.

A $2.7 trillion fund manager took its trades to a random guy and those trades ended up being front-run. The random guy and his accomplices made at least ₹65 crore ($7.5 million) in the process. Fun!

# Passing the information

When Capital Group’s traders wanted to buy a stock, they went to Rohit Salgaocar. Salgaocar didn’t work at an investment bank, he just had his own firm registered in Singapore called [Strait Crossing](https://sgpgrid.com/company-details/strait-crossing-pte-ltd), which doesn’t even have a website. Salgaocar’s apparent job was to arrange for sellers for whatever stock Capital wanted to buy.

When Capital’s traders told him about the stock they wanted to buy, Salgaocar passed it on to Ketan Parekh, a financial fraudster with a well-known history. Here’s Salgaocar’s statement to SEBI:

>\[…\] Rohit Salgaocar stated that for executing trades of the Big Client, he used to find counterparties through different market participants including foreign funds, Indian funds, other holders of the shares and Ketan Parekh. However, as per the statement of Rohit Salgaocar, around 90% of the Big Client trades were being fulfilled by Ketan Parekh alone.

Salgaocar told SEBI that his job was to look for sellers for Capital Group (the Big Client). And yet, he almost always took the the trades to Ketan Parekh. Did it worry him that Parekh had a history of financial fraud?

>Rohit Salgaocar has also stated that his extent of due diligence, before engaging with Ketan Parekh for Big Client trades, was just to check that Ketan Parekh was not banned from dealing in Indian Securities Market.

Oh well, low bar.

Once Ketan Parekh got his information, he activated a network of brokers and traders (at least 16 of them) who did exactly what Parekh asked them to do. Here’s an example. On September 19, 2022 at 9:59 am, Capital’s traders messaged Salgaocar telling him that they were in the market to buy HDFC stock. Within 4 minutes, Parekh told his buddies that they should start buying HDFC shares. By 10:33 am, they confirmed that they bought 100,000 HDFC shares at ₹2,433.32 each.

Next, and I don’t know what calculation they ran through their heads, but Salgaocar got back to Capital’s traders and offered HDFC’s shares at ₹2,446 per share, that’s ₹12.68 more than their buying price. Capital wanted 250,000 shares and placed its huge orders for HDFC, and Parekh and buddies sold their shares to Capital. They made ₹12.6 lakh ($14, 700) on this trade.

Some interesting points! Capital wanted to buy 250,000 shares but Parekh’s group had only bought 100,000. Yet Capital was able to get all the shares it wanted from the market at the price it wanted. Only about 40% of the 250,000 shares it bought came from Parekh. HDFC was a liquid stock! There was no need to whip up sellers to show up, they were always already there! The profit that Parekh made came from the price difference which Capital could have taken directly.

That’s how a bunch of other trades worked as well. In some situations, Capital wanted to sell a particular stock, and Parekh’s buddies shorted that stock instead. Everything put together, SEBI figured that Parekh and buddies made ₹38.7 crore ($4.5 million) by front-running Capital’s trades.

# The known unknown

Rohit Salgaocar is an interesting guy. There is no mention of his credentials anywhere and no one is sure why or how Capital Group engaged him as a middleman. From SEBI’s order:

>\[…\] the Big Client stated that it did not have any agreement with SCPL or Rohit Salgaocar. However, traders of the Big Client, who knew Rohit Salgaocar, engaged with him while trading with respect to securities listed in India. The trade related conversation between Rohit Salgaocar and traders of the Big Client used to happen over Bloomberg chats and calls. In their statements, the traders have stated that Big Client was aware of the dealings with Rohit Salgaocar.

Capital’s traders communicated with Salgaocar on Bloomberg Chat and that’s as official as it can get for finance folks. Yet, there was no real agreement between the two. They were passing on valuable information to some guy who didn’t technically owe them a thing.

>He had no agreement with the Big Client for his services and had commission sharing agreements with the Indian TMs viz. Motilal, Nuvama etc. As per the agreements, the brokers would give him 75% of the net brokerage income after excluding costs from the trades of the Big Client. \[…\] he had routed 90% of the Big Client trades through Nuvama and Motilal.

Salgaocar didn’t have an agreement with Capital Group, but he did have one with two large Indian stockbroking firms—Nuvama (earlier Edelweiss) and Motilal Oswal. Once Salgaocar got Parekh’s go-ahead, he would ask Capital’s traders to place their orders through one of Motilal or Nuvama. The agreement with the two brokers was that 75% of the brokerage they made would be Salgaocar’s fee. A referral fee for bringing in such a large client’s trades to them.

Salgaocar made ₹27.06 crore ($3 million) in the \~2 year period that SEBI investigated. This isn’t money he made shadily via front-running. This is money the brokers gave him because they felt they owed it to him legally! Salgaocar was making legal money but chose to help Ketan Parekh make some illegal money as well?

None of this makes sense! Why did Salgaocar pass on Capital’s trades in spite of making millions anyway? Why did Capital go to the broker Salgaocar liked and not the one that made the most sense for them? Even if Salgaocar *was* presumably bringing in sellers, and Capital knew that he is getting referral fees from the brokers, couldn’t it just cut the fees and negotiate a lower brokerage instead?

# Everyone’s connected

Here’s [what I wrote](https://boringmoney.in/p/guest-experts-on-zee-business-were#:~:text=One%20of%20the,Life%20is%20tough.) last year for another front-running case:

>One of the challenges that SEBI faces when proving securities fraud is connecting different parties involved in an apparent fraud with each other. Last year I wrote about an instance of near-certain insider trading that SEBI couldn’t defend because it couldn’t prove that the participants were connected beyond being in-laws. Life is tough.

Sometimes life is easy for SEBI, sometimes it isn’t. This particular case needed quite a bit of effort into proving that everyone was connected with one another. In the end SEBI did make a pretty compelling case.

Salgaocar’s involvement in the front-running seems to have been limited to the initial information collection phase. Once he passed on the information to Parekh, SEBI’s job was cut out to show that Parekh and his buddies interacted with each other in ways that would prove that they were trading based on Capital Group’s information

First, SEBI seized everyone’s mobile phones and read all the WhatsApp chats. \[3\] From those chats, it figured out which were the chats with Parekh. That was quite a task. From the SEBI order:

>It is noted that in none of the mobile phones, the contact numbers were saved in the name of Ketan Parekh and instead, various pseudo names such as, “Jack”, “John”, “Boss”, “Bhai”, “Wellwisher”, etc. were used to save these numbers.

Parekh had at least 10 different mobile numbers, and those numbers were saved with dummy names on the phones of Parekh’s buddies. The mobile numbers weren’t registered in Parekh’s name, so SEBI had to prove that the numbers indeed were used by Parekh. One way it did that was by getting the location history of the phones from Parekh’s network operators. There were some situations where the phones were showing up together in the same location.

It’s a bit funny where they were spotted—at hotels where the Parekhs were attending weddings. SEBI wrote to each hotel to confirm that Parekh did actually stay there:

>Hotel authorities, vide email dated November 03, 2023 confirmed the stay of Mr. & Mrs. Ketan Parekh in Room No. 340, for attending a wedding. Mr. & Mrs. Parekh has also shared their Aadhaar as identity proofs to the Hotel.

The hotel manager would not have expected to receive an email from the securities regulator! All the hotels were more than happy to share exactly when Parekh stayed with them and even his room number.

Parekh attended 4 weddings in 6 months. Being a social butterfly has its downsides.

# Pay up

This is bound to be the first of at least a couple of SEBI orders about this episode. To start with, SEBI wants to impound the ₹65 crore that Salgaocar, Parekh and the buddies made from the front-running. Salgaocar is a Singapore citizen though and made more than 40% of that money. I’m curious about how that’s going to turn out.

**Footnotes**

\[1\] I’m using the weird terms “less liquid” and “more liquid” because technically anything such a large fund buys *has* to be liquid. It’s not going to be able to buy truly illiquid stocks. So it’s just a matter of *how* liquid.

\[2\] There are other services that investment banks can offer. For instance, they can also buy shares on their own balance sheet if the fund’s willing to pay up for that privilege. Or they can help execute block trades at a fixed pre-decided price.

\[3\] How is it that they haven’t discovered automatically disappearing chats yet? SEBI’s case almost entirely relied on reading chats on WhatsApp.

2024-12-22,"CreditAccess Grameen: low-cost, customer-centric microlending at scale [OpenSourceInvestor]","CreditAccess Grameen seems to be a compelling long-term investment, as:

# Industry overview

Most investors deem the Indian Microfinance industry (MFI) as “un-investible” for various reasons, many of which are valid. However, this industry is an essential for financial inclusion in the country, as 80%+ of Indians do not have access to the traditional savings and loan industry. Hence, millions of individual Indians and SMEs depend on microfinance for both personal and business needs. The government recognizes this, and has classified MFI as a [priority sector for lending](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959#).

Traditional Indian banks often overlook rural borrowers due to their lack of credit history and collateral. Additionally, their limited branch networks, concentrated in urban areas, hinder accessibility for rural communities. As a result, nearly half of Indian borrowers rely on NBFCs and MFIs for credit.

# Recent turbulence in the Indian microfinance industry

Indian MFIs experienced several headwinds in 2024:

* Rising delinquencies caused by high inflation, heatwaves and over-leveraged borrowers: Bad loans (91-180 days overdue) increased from 1.2% in June 2024 to 1.9% in September 2024
* The gross loan portfolio (GLP) of MFIs shrunk by 3.86% in Q2 FY25
* Several MFIs like Spandana Sphoorty and IndusInd Bank had significant write-offs driven by higher NPAs
* The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took notice of the sector's issues and implemented stricter measures; It also banned 4 NBFCs — Asirvad Micro Finance, Arohan Financial Services, DMI Finance, and Navi Finserv over unreasonably high interest rates & fees, aggressive sales incentives and unsustainable business practices ([described in detail in this article](https://the-ken.com/story/rbi-had-better-explain-why-navi-and-dmi-finance-are-locked-out-of-the-loan-market/))

# Microfinance loan interest rates

The primary reason that MFIs charge higher interest rate is due to the higher OPEX, transaction costs and higher cost of funding, as shown below. Banks have access to low cost funding via current and savings accounts (4\~5%), while MFIs are dependent on the corporate credit market, where interest rates range between 9\~11% or higher. However, some un-organized players also take advantage of uninformed borrowers by charging interest rates as high as 5% per month (80% per annum!).

To put this in perspective, the global average interest and fee rate for microloans is estimated at [30\~37%, with rates reaching as high as 70% in some markets](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/world/14microfinance.html?pagewanted=all).

https://preview.redd.it/0o5byrykgd8e1.png?width=1271&format=png&auto=webp&s=161a281fecda6d57556b17dae40d0be748717c8b

Hence, the ROEs for traditional banks are similiar to MFIs, at around 12\~16%, even though MFIs charge twice the interest rate. MFIs also face higher cyclicality, as their borrowers usually have worse credit and are more exposed to socio-political issues and emergencies.

# Business model

# CreditAccess Grameen’s history

* Established in 1999 by Vinatha M. Reddy, inspired by the [Grameen Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Foundation), founded by Alex Counts and [Muhammad Yunus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UCuWxWiMaQ), with a grant of US$35,000 (INR \~3 crore)
* 2009: Paolo Bruchetti, who runs a Dutch-based Asia-focused microfinance fund invested INR 968 crore in CA Grameen; Now own 66.7% of the outstanding shares.
* 2010: Udaya Kumar Hebbar, a veteran banker, joined as CEO, and has acquired a larger role as MD and CEO since 2016
* 2018: IPO in August 2018 raising INR 1,131 crore; opened at around 400 INR/share
* 2023: Ganesh Narayanan was appointed as the CEO , while Udaya Kumar Hebbar continues to oversee the firm as MD
* 2024: the largest standalone microfinance MFI in the country, with \~5M customers and a loan book of ₹251 Bn. Note: Bandhan Bank is the largest small finance bank, with 35M customers and a loan book of ₹1300 Bn.

# Business overview

* 6% market share in microfinance loans, both in terms of customers and AUM
* Customer profile:
   * 99% women borrowers
   * 86% of borrowers are from rural India & 15% urban
   * 97% of loans use the JLG ([Joint Liability Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_liability_groups)) model, reducing the default risk from individual borrowers
* Unsecured, short term loans; Typically used for income generation , education, healthcare, nutrition, housing and emergencies
* Focus on keeping interest rates low for customers, with low OPEX, high collection efficiency and low cost of funding
* 19k employees in total; 96% of these employees are from the local community
* Operate 2031 branches across 17 states / union territories; The branch network has grown at 9% CAGR over the past five years; They have been adding around 30\~50 districts annually since 2022

https://preview.redd.it/7prh8kingd8e1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=159f7d162798327c92d7163dbbcfe965bace92dc

# Management

* Since 2009/2010, when Udaya Kumar Hebbar took over, the bank has professionalized its management and operations
* The company has managed to grow the loan book by 15%+ CAGR in the last decade, while still maintaining a healthy balance sheet and provisions. They have also constantly reduced the OPEX & cost-to-income ratio, showing a focus on operational efficiency.
* There have been [news reports](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/creditaccess-grameen-up-for-sale-dutch-owner-seeks-2-7-billion-valuation-124081200347_1.html) that Paolo Bruchetti’s firm is planning to sell their stake. However, the promoter is not involved in day-to-day operations even today, so I don’t expect any major changes to management team or company culture.

# Financials

# Unit economics

* A survey conducted by the company ([page 17](https://www.creditaccessgrameen.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CreditAccess-Grameen_Annual-Report_FY-2023-24.pdf)) indicated that 64% customers increased their monthly income by 25%\~100%; Typical sources of income: agriculture, daily wage labour, livestock and other small businesses
   * Apart from income generation, the other typical use cases for a micro-loan are education, healthcare, nutrition, housing and emergencies
* Average income of rural households is [around ₹12,700 per month](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/average-income-of-rural-households-up-58-between-fy17-fy22-survey/articleshow/114130363.cms#:~:text=The%20average%20monthly%20income%20of,notably%20for%20non%2Dagricultural%20households.); using this figure, the average customer increased their income by ₹3175\~₹12,700 (25%\~100%) per month after interest payments; Annually ₹38,100\~₹152,400
* The average ticket size seems to be around ₹50,000; Hence the annual returns for a typical borrower are between 76%\~300%; Hence, the interest rate charged on a micro-finance loan (19\~21%) should be payable, leading to a win-win outcome for both the borrower and the MFI company
* However, borrowers also take on significant risk - if their business ventures do not immediately yield positive returns, many would struggle to pay back the loans; In the case of a widespread natural disaster or emergency (like to COVID lockdown), many of these customers struggle to repay their loans, leading to high NPAs (non-performing assets) for the MFI industry

# Profitability

* Net interest margin has been around 13%, which should lead to a return on equity of 15\~20% if NPAs remain similiar to their historical averages

https://preview.redd.it/odb6y0uqgd8e1.png?width=1352&format=png&auto=webp&s=1435352e5d575f3e88873c67e3fcfecd853e5119

* Due to higher NPAs & provisions in the last quarter, ROE has dropped to 10%; However, I expect this to recover in the coming quarters. For reference, their ROE has been 15% on average over the last 8 years.

https://preview.redd.it/pkkfwm0sgd8e1.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9984e5be7c8d4f8589e7028a565557ba3562944

# Capital allocation and dividend

* A majority of earnings is funneled into expansion, with around 11% of earnings paid out in dividend

# Competitive advantages / moat

CreditAccess Grameen seems to be the highest quality and most customer centric company in the MFI space.

* Lowest lending rates in MFI industry
* Low OPEX, due to a focus on efficient customer acquisition and branch operations
* The widest branch network with local workforce gives them a deep understanding of each district and its surrounding areas
* High customer trust & loyalty
   * 84%-88% customer retention rate over the last several years
   * 95% of existing customers are aware that CA Grameen charges the lowest interest rate
* Strong internal controls and risk management, evidenced by a spotless legal & governance track record
* Conservative balance sheet: the company maintains a high CRAR (Capital to Risk Assets Ratio) of 26%, compared to the 15% minimum recommended by RBI

This has led to a combination of high RoE & low NNPA, compared to their peers.

https://preview.redd.it/5y3kis5ugd8e1.png?width=1636&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a2f763714c305a28d3095b77896c4242509cbca

# Runway / future growth potential

Management has guided for an ambitious 20-25% CAGR over the next 4-5 years, with plans to cross ₹500 billion gross AUM by FY28 (currently ₹251 billion in Q2 FY25). This seems ambitious, but achievable, given their track record.

# Risks

* **A primarily unsecured loan book and high income volatility for borrowers** could lead to high default rates. They’ve had default rates ranging between 2\~4% in the last 10 years, with the exception of COVID, where they increased to 7\~8%
* **High concentration in 3 states** (65% of borrowers and 73% of AUM): Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Social or political unrest in one of these states could have a significant impact on collection efficiency and delinquencies .
* **High competition** \- there are over a 100 MFIs and 9300 medium/small NBFCs; A few examples of high quality competitors: Ujjivan SFB, Equitas SFB, L&T Finance & Can Fin Homes
* **The evolving regulatory framework** could affect their strategy or limit their growth; However, as they are one of the best-run and lowest cost providers in the industry, I don’t think this is a significant risk

https://preview.redd.it/k779ttmvgd8e1.png?width=1387&format=png&auto=webp&s=12a5b89c89d048d8c798d572036c9d8f91ffe8a7

# Valuation

The valuation summary is shown below.

* In a worst-case scenario, returns might be modest, similar to a bank FD (6% IRR)
* A more likely outcome (base case) is a 15% IRR
* However, if management's optimistic outlook (bull case) materializes, the stock price could double in the coming months, especially if NPAs go back to their average historical levels

This asymmetric risk-reward profile makes it a compelling investment at current prices.

It is also trading well below its historical earnings multiples and price/book:

# Conclusion

Prof. Sanjay Bakshi recently mentioned the micro-lending industry in an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2451&v=iWiLu_byjRA&feature=youtu.be):

>

Based on my research, CreditAccess Grameen seems to be the strongest player in Indian microfinance (lowest interest rates, efficiently run, healthy capital adequacy and funding). It seems to be following Charlie Munger’s “Win-Win-Win” model.

If you think there any other micro-lenders in India that are better quality than CreditAccess Grameen considering the long-term runway (5\~10 years+) - let me know.

Thanks for reading. Feedback & differing views are welcome!

If you were to plot the risk of owning a company’s stock against its lifetime it would look something like this:

[Image URL](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9a1eab7-1814-4a30-b011-319fe6b9a314_1024x768.png)

The younger a company, the riskier its stock. As it lives its life, figures its lessons, makes some money, that risk tends to go down. It’s still risky to own the stock! Just a little bit less. Somewhere in between its transition from extremely risky to a little-less risky, there is a magical blip in a company’s lifetime where its stock is probably the least risky to own. Right before it goes public! \[1\]

One reason a young company has more risk is that its future is uncertain. The founders might fight! Or the product might be a scam! But another reason is that the stock of a company is illiquid. If you’re an investor in a young company, you can’t just go out in the open market, sell the company’s stock and call it a day. \[2\]

But once a company has decided to go public and done all the good stuff—brought in bankers to market the stock, decided on how much money it wants to raise, agreed on a valuation—there is a brief period where the investor avoids the second kind of risk. You’re still an investor in a private company with illiquid stock, but now you know for sure that there are buyers lined up for you to sell your stock to. That liquidity makes your stock less risky and more valuable.

If you own a company’s stock in this pre-IPO period, I don’t know, you probably want to sit tight and revel in this magical feeling of risk-free(ish) stock ownership?

Well, earlier this month, Paytm sold its stake in PayPay, a Japanese fintech company which is the country’s largest mobile payments app. Here’s a snippet from its stock exchange [filing disclosing the sale](https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/12109acb-b6c7-49e5-b4b4-bb1e0170ea94.pdf):

>\[…\] One97 Communications Singapore Private Limited (Paytm Singapore), has approved sale of Stock Acquisition Rights (SARs) held in PayPay Corporation, Japan (PayPay).

>These SARs, acquired by Paytm Singapore in September, 2020 will be sold to a SoftBank Vision Fund 2 entity for net proceeds of JPY 41.9 billion. Through this deal, PayPay is valued at JPY 1.06 trillion and accordingly, PayPay SARs held by Paytm Singapore are valued at net proceeds of JPY 41.9 billion (after netting off the exercise cost of SARs).

Paytm held some stock options, which the Japanese [refer to as](https://group.softbank/en/news/press/20230728_0) stock acquisition rights, of PayPay for the last 4 years. Exercising those stock options would give Paytm at least a few percentage points of stake in the company. It could have waited for its IPO, but instead it chose to sell to SoftBank. Oh that’s while SoftBank already owns a controlling stake in PayPay.

Paytm’s sale of its PayPay stake isn’t quite the same as the hypothetical I began with. But it’s close! SoftBank has wanted to take PayPay public for [longer than a year](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/softbank-considering-us-listing-paypay-payments-business-sources-2023-07-12/) now, so its IPO might not happen right away. But the specific timeline isn’t important. PayPay is doing pretty well, is somewhat close to an IPO, and its owner is more than willing to increase its stake in the company. And Paytm is in no desperation for cash—it’s got [₹10,000 crore](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/paytm-to-add-rs-2364-crore-to-its-kitty-through-sale-of-paypay-shares/articleshow/116084709.cms?from=mdr) ($1.2 billion) in the bank. It would make sense to just hold on and sell it in the IPO. Such a weird sale.

# Confusing stake

In 2021, Paytm [reported](https://paytm.com/document/ir/ipo-documents/paytm-red-herring-prospectus.pdf) that its stock options would give it a 7.2% stake in PayPay. Earlier this year in its June quarter [results](https://paytm.com/document/ir/financial-results/Earnings-Release_INR_FY25-Q1.pdf), it said that its stock options would give it a 5.4% stake.

Totally understandable! There’s more than three years between these two disclosures. Maybe PayPay raised more money, or gave more stock options, and Paytm’s expected stake reduced as a result.

But what is the stake that Paytm sold this month to SoftBank? Paytm didn’t share the figure so let’s look at the numbers. It says it got ¥41.9 billion (₹2,364 crore) and that PayPay was valued at ¥1.06 trillion (₹59,360 crore)—so that’s only about a 3.95% stake? That’s 28% less than its disclosure just a few months ago.

I’m confused. And it’s not just me, here are news articles reporting Paytm’s stake as 3.95%, [5.4%](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/paytm-to-add-rs-2364-crore-to-its-kitty-through-sale-of-paypay-shares/articleshow/116084709.cms?from=mdr#:~:text=is%20selling%20its-,5.4%25,-shareholding%20in%20Japanese) and somehow even as [7.2%](https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/paytm-sells-7-2-per-cent-stake-in-paypay-transaction-stimated-at-rs-2000-crore/cid/2068933) (though that’s obviously incorrect). Let’s look at Paytm’s stock exchange filing again:

>These SARs, acquired by Paytm Singapore in September, 2020 will be sold to a SoftBank Vision Fund 2 entity for net proceeds of JPY 41.9 billion. Through this deal, PayPay is **valued at JPY 1.06 trillion** and accordingly, PayPay SARs held by Paytm Singapore are valued at net proceeds of JPY 41.9 billion (after netting off the exercise cost of SARs).

The last two times Paytm mentioned PayPay, it was sure to mention its stake in the company. But when it actually sells its stake, it mentions the PayPay’s valuation instead? It almost feels like Paytm is speaking to PayPay’s investors here in place of its own.

# Do me a favour?

That’s two unusual things Paytm did. Sold its stake in PayPay when it didn’t need to, and didn’t mention what its stake actually was.

Before Paytm went public in 2021, SoftBank owned a large 18% stake in the company. But Paytm’s stock did badly after its IPO, and it also had [some run-ins](https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/rbi-ban-on-paytm-payments-bank-one-97-communications-stock-trades-nearly-80-lower-than-the-ipo-price-11706863311082.html) with the RBI causing its price to crash. SoftBank, being the shrewd investor that it is, ended up selling its entire stake when Paytm’s stock price was low. It ended up making a $544 million [loss](https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/softbank-vision-fund-records-544-million-loss-on-full-exit-from-paytm-article-12790131.html) on its $1.6 billion investment. (Paytm’s stock price has since recovered from its crash but is still below its IPO price.)

SoftBank was the reason Paytm got PayPay’s shares in the first place. SoftBank owns PayPay and it wanted to replicate in Japan exactly what Paytm did in India. So it just asked Paytm to help out PayPay with its tech and paid Paytm with PayPay shares instead of cash.

I don’t know if these events have anything to do with each other, but here’s how I’m looking at it. Paytm [seems to like](https://boringmoney.in/p/paytm-is-returning-excess-cash-before) its pre-IPO venture capital investors better than its public investors. Softbank and Paytm’s founders are probably buddies meeting up with each other at [weddings](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/masayoshi-son-is-happy-enjoying-india-trip-says-paytms-vijay-shekhar-sharma-10214331.html) and stuff. But Softbank lost quite a lot of money on Paytm! $544 million! Awkward.

PayPay was a very successful investment for Paytm. Sure, it could have got more out of it, but eh, who cares. SoftBank lost a lot of money on Paytm and why not just let it make some of it back with PayPay instead? \[3\] Paytm’s public investors [don’t seem to mind](https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/paytm-share-price-jumps-3-hits-52-week-high-on-stake-sale-in-paypay-corp-to-softbank-11733716972942.html).

**Footnotes**

**\[1\]** Not that it needs to be said, but there is no remotely scientific basis for me to say this.

\[2\] Lots of exceptions! If you’re an investor in a highly sought after private company such as OpenAI or Stripe, their stock is pretty liquid! You can’t sell their stock as easily as you would that of a publicly listed company, but it would be pretty close.

\[3\] By reporting PayPay’s valuation in its stock exchange disclosure, Paytm also set an external benchmark for its valuation when it eventually goes public.

If you were to plot the risk of owning a company’s stock against its lifetime it would look something like this:

Generally speaking, there is no best stock, or fund, or bank, or brokerage, or investment platform.

Answers are always subjective to your personal needs, but use those threads a starting point for you to look at what other Redditors have to say about a company, product, fund, or service.

You can then ask a more specific question about what product or service to buy, once you are able to frame your personal situation.

**NOTE** If your question is _I got 10k INR, what do I do to get most returns out of it?_, or anything similar; there is no single answer to this question. But we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to provide some sort of answer:

- How old are you?
- Are you employed/making income?
- How much? What are your objectives with this money?
- Do you have any loan, or big expense coming up?
- What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know it's 100% safe?)
- What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Have you invested in equity before?)
- Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Partner pushing you to spend more?
- What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
- Any big debts?
- Any other relevant financial information about you, that will be useful to give you an informed response.

Beware that these answers are just opinions of fellow Redditors and should only be used as a starting point for your research. This is **NOT** financial advice, in legal sense of the term.

You should strongly consider consulting a registered fee-only financial advisor before making any financial decisions. Ideally, such advisors should be registered with SEBI, and have a registration number.
